(Adición de números reales)
**Addition of real numbers**: Addition is the operation of adding numbers together. Addition means starting at the end of the first number, and then moving the amount being added by the second number.
[Addition code](Programs/S03/Addition.py)

Addition is the inverse operation of subtraction. Given that addition means after the first number move the amount of the second, commutativity means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the end position is the same.

Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting its opposite (just as adding a positive number is the same as subtracting its opposite). Addition means moving in the same direction of the number being added, if the number being added is positive then the addition moves in the positive direction, if the number being added is negative then the addition moves in the negative direction.

(Operador suma)
**Sum operator**: this operator is $+$, the plus sign.

(Notación de la suma)
**Addition notation**: the addition of $a$ and $b$ is $a + b = c$, read as $a$ plus $b$ ($a$ más $b$), $a$, $b$ are called the addends (sumandos), the result $c$ is called the sum (suma).

> The addition of $a$ and $b$ is $c$
> $$a + b = c$$

(Propiedad de identidad de la suma)
**Identity property of addition**: adding a real number with zero doesn't change the number.

> Identity property of addition
>
> Let $a$ be a real number, then
> $$a + 0 = a$$

(Identidad aditiva)
**Additive identity**: The number 0.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la suma)
**Commutative property of addition**: changing the order of the addends doesn't change the sum.

> Commutative property of addition
>
> Let $a$, $b$ be real numbers, then
> $$a + b = b + a$$

(Propiedad asociativa de la adición)
**Associative property of addition**: using grouping symbols to group addition operations does not change the sum.

> Associative property of addition
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be real numbers, then
> $$a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$

(Inverso aditivo)
**Additive inverse**: the opposite of a number, is its additive inverse. The additive inverse of a number $a$ is $-a$.

(Propiedad inversa aditiva)
**Inverse property of addition**: the sum of a number and its additive inverse is zero.

> Inverse property of addition
>
> Let $a$ be a real number, then
> $$a + (-a) = a - a = 0$$

(Adición de fracciones con denominador común)
**Addition of fractions with common denominators**: the same as normal addition. It must be noted that $\frac{a}{b} = a\frac{1}{b}$, which means that $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{b} = a\frac{1}{b} + c\frac{1}{b} = (a + c)\frac{1}{b} = \frac{a + c}{b}$.

(Adición de fracciones con denominador diferente)
**Addition of fractions with different denominators**: first the fractions being added must have common denominators, for this, each fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction such that its denominator is the common one. The common denominator can be found as the least common denominator of the fractions. The addition is done like regular addition when the denominators are common.

(Adición de números mixtos)
**Addition of mixed numbers**: like regular addition. The integer parts of the mixed numbers can be added directly, and the proper fraction parts are added with the rules of addition of fractions, the result is the sum of the integer and fraction parts. To show the result as a mixed number, the integer part is left alone, and the fraction part is converted to a proper fraction if necessary, this may change the integer part.

(Sustracción de números reales)
**Subtraction of real numbers**: Subtraction is the operation of subtracting a number from another. Subtraction means starting at the end of the first number, and then moving in the opposite direction the amount of units being subtracted by the second number. Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition.
[Subtraction code](Programs/S03/Subtraction.py)

Subtracting a negative number means moving opposite to its direction, i.e. moving in the positive direction. In $a - (-b)$ the expression $- (-b)$ subtracts negative $b$, so moving opposite to negative $b$ means adding positive $b$, and $a - (-b) = a + b$.

Subtraction is not commutative.

> Non commutativity of subtraction
>
> Let $a$, $b$ be numbers,
>
> $$\begin{gathered}
> if\ a \ne b\\
> then\ a - b \ne b - a
> \end{gathered}$$

(Operador resta)
**Subtraction operator**: this operator is $-$, the minus sign.

(Notación de la sustracción)
**Subtraction notation**: the subtraction of $a$ from $b$ is $b - a = c$, read as $b$ minus $a$ ($b$ menos $a$), $b$ is called the minuend (minuendo), $a$ is called the subtrahend (sustraendo), the result $c$ is called the difference (diferencia).

> The subtraction of $b$ from $a$ is $c$
> $$b - a = c$$
> The value $c$ is the difference.

(Sustracción de fracciones con denominador común)
**Subtraction of fractions with common denominators**: the same as normal subtraction. It must be noted that $\frac{a}{b} = a\frac{1}{b}$, which means that $\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{b} = a\frac{1}{b} - c\frac{1}{b} = (a - c)\frac{1}{b} = \frac{a - c}{b}$.

(Sustracción de fracciones con denominador diferente)
**Subtraction of fractions with different denominator**: first the fractions being subtracted must have common denominators, for this, each fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction such that its denominator is the common one. The common denominator can be found as the least common denominator of the fractions. The subtraction is done like regular subtraction when the denominators are common.

(Sustracción de números mixtos)
**Subtraction of mixed numbers**: the integer parts of the mixed numbers can be subtracted directly, and the proper fraction parts are subtracted with the rules of subtraction of fractions, the result is the difference of the integer and fraction parts. To show the result as a mixed number, the integer part is left alone, and the fraction part is converted to a proper fraction if necessary, this may change the integer part. As with addition, the integer parts are subtracted separately from the fraction parts.

(Multiplicación de números reales)
**Multiplication of real numbers**: multiplication is the operation of multiplying numbers together. Multiplication means the repeated addition of a number with itself, the amount of repeated additions is the other number in the operation.
[Multiplication code](Programs/S03/Multiplication.py)

Multiplication is the inverse operation of division. Given that multiplication means the repeated addition of the first number with itself a number of times equal to the second number, this means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the final repeated addition is the same.

In a multiplication operation, if the amount of repeated additions is negative, then this means repeated addition with each addition done in the opposite direction. For example, $4 \cdot -3 = -4 -4 -4$, each addition is done in the opposite direction of $4$, and in $-4 \cdot -3 = 4 + 4 + 4$, each addition is done in the opposite direction of $-4$.

(Operador multiplicación)
**Multiplication operator**: this operator is $\times$, the times sign. Another is $\cdot$, the dot sign. Another is $()$, the parentheses signs.

(Notación de la multiplicación)
**Multiplication notation**: the multiplication of $a$ and $b$ is $ab = c$, read as $a$ times $b$ ($a$ veces $b$), $a$, $b$ are called the factors (factores), the result $c$ is called the product (producto).

> The multiplication of $a$ and $b$ is $c$
> $$ab = c$$
> The value $c$ is the product.

(Propiedad anulativa de la multiplicación)
**Multiplication property of zero**: the product of any number multiplied by 0, is 0.

> Multiplication property of zero
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \cdot 0 = 0$$

(Propiedad modulativa de la multiplicación)
**Identity property of multiplication**: the product of any number multiplied by 1, is the number itself.

> Identity property of multiplication
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \cdot 1 = a$$

(Identidad multiplicativa | elemento neutro | elemento identidad)
**Multiplicative identity**: The number 1.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la multiplicación)
**Commutative property of multiplication**: changing the order of the factors doesn't change the product.

> Commutative property of multiplication
>
> Let $a$, $b$, be numbers, then
> $$ab = ba$$

(Propiedad asociativa de la multiplicación)
**Associative property of multiplication**: using grouping symbols to group multiplication operations does not change the product.

> Associative property of multiplication
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be numbers, then
> $$abc = (ab) c = a (bc)$$

(Propiedad distributiva de la multiplicación respecto a la suma)
**Distributive property of multiplication over addition**: a real number multiplying the sum of other real numbers, is equal to the sum of the products of the real number by each of the other real numbers.

> Distributive property
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be real numbers, then
> $$a (b + c) = ab + ac$$

This property shows itself when multiplying $a$ by the sum $b + c$, the resulting product can be seen as the sum of $a b$ and $a c$. This property actually includes subtraction as a case of the sum, given that the addends can be negative numbers.

(Inverso multiplicativo)
**Multiplicative inverse**: the reciprocal of a number, is its multiplicative inverse. The multiplicative inverse of a number $a$ is $\frac{1}{a}$.

(Propiedad inversa de la multiplicación)
**Inverse property of multiplication**: the product of a number and its multiplicative inverse is one.

> Inverse property of multiplication
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \frac{1}{a} = 1$$

(Multiplicación por -1)
**Multiplication by -1**: a number multiplied by $-1$ results in its opposite.

> Multiply a number by $-1$
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$-1 \cdot a = -a$$

Using the definition of multiplication, multiplying $a$ by $-1$ is the same as adding $a$ one time in its opposite direction, which is $-a$, the opposite of $a$.

(Multiplicación por 0)
**Multiplication by 0**: the product of any number and 0 is 0.

> Multiply a number by 0
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \cdot 0 = 0$$

This is because $a$ is added $0$ times with itself.

(Multiplicación de fracciones)
**Fraction multiplication**: the product of two fractions is the product of the numerators over the product of the denominators, $\frac{a}{b} \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a c}{b d}$, this implies two operations, first the multiplication by $c$ and then the division by $d$. Given the PEMDAS order of operations, it's the same if the division by $d$ is done first.

(División de números reales)
**Division of real numbers**: division is the operation of dividing a first number by a second number. Division means the repeated subtraction of the second number from the first number until reaching 0, the amount of repeated subtractions is the result of the operation.
[Division code](Programs/S03/Division.py)

Division is the inverse operation of Multiplication.

Division means repeated subtraction until reaching 0, if the amount of repeated subtractions is negative, then this means repeated subtraction with each subtraction done in the opposite direction. For example, $24 \div -8 = -3$ so the number $-8$ is subtracted $-3$ times from $24$, i.e. $-8$ is subtracted three times in its opposite direction to reach 0 starting at 24. In $-24 \div -8 = 3$ the amount of repeated subtractions is positive, so $-8$ is subtracted directly from $-24$ three times to reach 0.

Division is not commutative.

> Let $a$, $b$ be numbers,
>
> $$\begin{gathered}
> if\ a \ne b\\
> then\ \frac{a}{b} \ne \frac{b}{a}
> \end{gathered}$$

(Operador división)
**Division operator**: this operator is $\div$, the division sign. Another is $/$, the slash sign. Another is $\text{---}$, the horizontal line sign.

(Notación de la división)
**Division notation**: the division of $b$ over $a$ is $\frac{b}{a} = c$, read as $b$ divided by $a$ ($b$ dividido $a$), $b$ is called the dividend (dividendo), $a$ is called the divisor (divisor), the result $c$ is called the quotient (cociente).

> The division of $b$ over $a$ is
> $$\frac{b}{a} = c$$
> The value $c$ is the quotient.

(Propiedad modulativa de la división)
**Identity property of division**: the quotient of any number divided by 1, is the number itself.

> Identity property of division
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$\frac{a}{1} = a$$

(Identidad divisiva)
**Divisive identity**: The number 1.

(Propiedad del cociente uno de la división)
**Division property of quotient one**: any nonzero number divided by itself gives a quotient of 1.

> Division property of quotient one
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$\frac{a}{a} = 1$$

(Propiedades del cero en la división)
**Division properties of zero**: zero divided by any nonzero number is zero. Division by zero is undefined.

> Zero divided by a nonzero number
>
> Let $a$ be a real number, then
> $$\frac{0}{a} = 0$$

> Division by zero is undefined
>
> Let $a$ be a real number, then
> $$\frac{a}{0}\ is\ undefined$$

(División por -1)
**Division by -1**: a number divided by $-1$ results in its opposite.

> Divide a number by $-1$
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \div -1 = -a$$

Using the definition of division, dividing $a$ by $-1$ is the same as subtracting $-1$ from $a$ until reaching 0, which is $-a$ times, the opposite of $a$.

(Recíproco de un número)
**Reciprocal of a number**: given a number, its reciprocal is another number such that when multipled together the product is 1. In $\frac{a}{b}$, the reciprocal is $\frac{b}{a}$, because $\frac{a}{b} \frac{b}{a} = \frac{a b}{b a} = 1$, and so $a \ne 0$, $b \ne 0$, which means that 0 doesn't have a reciprocal.

Non fraction numbers also have a reciprocal, the reciprocal of $a$ is $\frac{1}{a}$ because $a \frac{1}{a} = 1$. Using the definition of division, $\frac{1}{a}$ means taking the number $1$ and dividing it into $a$ groups, then $\frac{1}{a}$ is the size of each group, which is the same as the place where the first group ends, this place is the definition of the reciprocal of $a$.

(Invertir un número)
**Invert a number**: the process of finding the reciprocal of a number. When a number is inverted the result is its reciprocal.

(División de fracciones)
**Fraction division**: the operation $\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}$. This implies two operations, division by $c$ and division by the reciprocal of $d$ which is the same as multiplication by $d$, so $\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bc}$.

(Residuo | Resto)
**Remainder**: in division, this is the number that is left over after doing the repeated subtraction, if any.
[Remainder code](Programs/S03/Remainder.py)

> Division with quotient and remainder
>
> Let $a$, $b$ be numbers with $b$ being nonzero, let $q$ be the quotient, $r$ be the remainder, then
> $$\frac{a}{b} = q + \frac{r}{b}$$

(Paradigma de la multiplicación y división)
**Multiplication and division paradigm**: when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, it changes the sign of the other number, so multiplying or dividing a negative number by another negative number results in a positive number, and multiplying or dividing a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.

Multiplication and division both deal with three concepts: a set of elements, groups of elements, and the size of said groups. Each of this concepts is associated with a number, the total number of elements, the amount of groups, and the size of each group.

Multiplication returns the total number of elements as the product of the amount of groups by the size of each group. For example, $5$ groups of size $4$, have a total number of elements of $5 \cdot 4 = 20$, and $4$ groups each with $5$ elements, have a total number of elements of $4 \cdot 5 = 20$. By itself, the total number of elements remains the same, $20$.

In multiplication, the amount of groups is interchangeable with the size of each group, so a multiplication can be interpreted as the amount of groups times their size, or as the size of the groups times the amount of groups, both interpretations are valid for any single multiplication.

Division has a similar behavior, the total number of elements is the dividend, but then, the divisor can be any of the other two numbers. The divisor can be the amount of groups, or the size of each group, and the quotient is the other number. For example, $24 \div 8 = 3$ means, from the $24$ total elements, with groups of size $8$, then there are $3$ groups, but $24 \div 8 = 3$ also means that from the $24$ total elements, with $8$ groups, each will have a size of $3$. Both conclusions are arrived via repeated subtraction.

The interpretation of $24 \div 8 = 3$ as $24$ elements divided in $8$ groups have a group size of $3$, means that there are $3$ elements per each $1$ group, so $24 \div 8 = 3 \div 1$, in words it could be read as, there are $24$ elements each $8$ groups, or there are $3$ elements each $1$ group.

Multiplication by a number is the same as division by its reciprocal, $ab = a \div \frac{1}{b}$, because it follows the definition of division as repeated subtraction. Starting from $a$, to reach 0 by subtracting $\frac{1}{b}$, it must be done $a b$ times, this is because to reach 0 by subtracting $1$ it is done $a$ times, $\frac{a}{1} = a$, and to do it by subtracting $\frac{1}{b}$, it must be done $b$ times as much.

Division by a number is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal, $\frac{a}{b} = a \frac{1}{b}$, because having $a$ elements divided in $b$ groups, has each group with size $\frac{a}{b}$, and adding $a$ with itself only a fraction $\frac{1}{b}$ times, ends being at the same place of $\frac{a}{b}$.

(Multiplicación y división por 10)
**Multiplication and division by 10**: given that 10 is the base of the decimal place value system, multiplying a number by 10 moves the number one digit to the left, while dividing a number by 10 moves the number one digit to the right. For example, $2 \cdot 10 = 20$, and $2 \div 10 = 0.2$.

(Multiplicación y división de decimales)
**Multiplication and division of decimals**: like regular multiplication and division. When doing division, an infinite amount of decimal digits can appear. When doing multiplication, the amount of decimal digits is up to the sum of the decimal digits in the factors.

(Potenciación)
**Exponentiation**: the operation of raising a number to a given power, e.g. $a^n$.
[Exponentiation code](Programs/S03/Exponentiation.py)

(Notación exponencial)
**Exponential notation**: used in expressions where a number is multiplied by itself several times, for example, $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$ is written as $2^4$.

> General exponential notation
>
> Let $a$ be a number, $n$ be a whole number, then
> $$aaa \ldots a = a^n$$
> The value $n$ is the amount of times that $a$ is multiplied by itself.

Using the shown symbols, the exponential notation is read as $a$ to the $n$-th power ($a$ a la $n$-ésima potencia), also read as $a$ to the power of $n$ ($a$ a la $n$).

The operation itself is read as raise $a$ to the $n$-th power (elevar $a$ a la $n$-ésima potencia), also read as raise $a$ to the power of $n$ (elevar $a$ a la $n$).

(Redondeo)
**Rounding**: approximating a number with another of less significant digits.
[Rounding code](Programs/S03/Rounding.py)

(Función techo)
**Ceiling function**: a function that approximates a number to the nearest bigger integer. Denoted as $\lceil x \rceil$, where $x$ is the number being rounded, e.g. $\lceil 2.5 \rceil = 3$, $\lceil -2.5 \rceil = -2$.

(Función piso)
**Floor function**: a function that approximates a number to the nearest smaller integer. Denoted as $\lfloor x \rfloor$, where $x$ is the number being rounded, e.g. $\lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 2$, $\lfloor -2.5 \rfloor = -3$.

(Truncamiento)
**Truncation**: rounding a number by removing all digits after the decimal point, e.g. $2.5$ truncated is $2$, and $-2.5$ truncated is $-2$.
