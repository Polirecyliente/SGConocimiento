(Sistema de numeración posicional)
**Place value system**: system in which the value of a digit depends on its place in the number.

(Sistema de numeración decimal)
**Decimal place value system**: the most common place value system, each place is a power of 10, from right to left, starting at 0 in the first place, 1 in the second place and so on, so 10 is the base of the place value system, e.g. $345$ is $3$ in the third position ($3$ of 10 to the power of 2), $4$ is in the second position ($4$ of 10 to the power of 1), and $5$ is in the first position ($5$ of 10 to the power of 0).

(Forma expandida de los números)
**Expanded form of the numbers**: numbers in a place value system can be shown in an expanded form, this expanded form is the sum of each of the digits in a given number multiplied by the base of the place value system to the power of its respective position, e.g. $345$ in expanded form is $3 \cdot 10^2 + 4 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0$.

(Grupos en la numeración posicional)
**Plave value periods**: these periods are the separation of digits in groups of three, each has a name, ones, thousands, millions, thousandths, millionths, etcetera.
