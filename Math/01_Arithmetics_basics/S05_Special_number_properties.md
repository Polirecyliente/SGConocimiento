(Números enteros consecutivos)
**Consecutive integers**: integers that follow each other by adding $1$ repeatedly, e.g. $-4$, $-3$, $-2$, or $19$, $20$, $21$, etcetera.

(Ternas pitagóricas)
**Pythagorean triples**: groups of three counting numbers that can make the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. For example $3$, $4$, and $5$ are counting numbers that can build a right triangle because $5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25 = 9 + 16$. Multiples of a pythagorean triple are also pythagorean triples, for example $9$, $12$, and $15$, because $15^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 = 225 = 81 + 144$.

(Pruebas de divisibilidad)
**Divisibility tests**: a quick test made to check if an integer is divisible by another. The following are the divisibility tests of the first positive integers.

A given integer is divisible by 2 if its last digit is an even number.
A given integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
A given integer is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4.
A given integer is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
A given integer is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by 2 and 3.
A given integer is divisible by 7 if its last digit is doubled and then subtracted from the rest of the number, and the result of that is divisible by 7.
A given integer is divisible by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8.
A given integer is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
A given integer is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.
A given integer is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (i.e. the first digit, minus the second, plus the third, minus the fourth, etc.) is divisible by 11.
