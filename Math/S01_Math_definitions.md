(Axioma)
**Axiom**: facts of math that are accepted as true without proof.

(Teorema)
**Theorem**: a statement that can be proved with postulates, axioms and/or with other theorems.

(Corolario)
**Corollary**: a theorem that is not proved, because it's too small and its true follows directly from another theorem or axiom, so it doesn't need to be proved.

(Demostración textual)
**Paragraph proof**: a proof that is written in paragraphs. To show where it ends, the symbol $\blacksquare$ is used.

(Demostraciones a dos columnas)
**Two column proofs**: a way to write mathematical proofs in a structured manner. The proof is written in a table with two columns. The first column has the header of 'Statement', and its rows contain the steps of the proof. The second column has the header of 'Reason', and its rows state the reason why the step they accompany is correct.

| Statement | Reason           |
| :-------: | :--------------: |
| Step1     | Reason1          |
| (1) Step2 | Reason2          |
| Step3     | Reason3 from (1) |
*Two column proof template*

Step1 is supported by Reason1, Step2 is supported by Reason2, and so on. If ReasonN is a conditional statement, then StepN must be the conclusion or consequent of that conditional statement. For clarity, a parentheses pair with a number can be added to a step, so that it's clear from which step a given reason stems. In the *Two column proof template* table, Reason3 stems from Step2, this is shown with the parentheses '(1)'.

(Demostración por contradicción)
**Indirect proof**: type of proof of a conditional in which the consequent is negated, and by deduction a contradiction is found, which means that the consequent is true.

(Símbolo entonces)
**Then symbol**: the symbol of a double right arrow $\Rightarrow$ is used in mathematics in general, to signify 'then'.

(Mapeo de un punto a otro)
**Mapping from a point to another**: mappings are a way to symbolize geometric transformations in the coordinate plane. Let the point $(x, y)$ be transformed into the point $(x', y')$, this can be denoted as $(x, y) \to (x', y')$, read as the point $(x, y)$ is mapped to $(x', y')$ (el punto $(x, y)$ es mapeado a $(x', y')$).
