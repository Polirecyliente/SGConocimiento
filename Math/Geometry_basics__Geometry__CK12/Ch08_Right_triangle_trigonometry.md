## The pythagorean theorem (El teorema de Pitágoras)
[Ch08_S01](https://www.ck12.org/reader/reader-index.html#section/2932971/8.1/9549314)

The pythagorean theorem and its proof have already been introduced (see Ch03_Parallel_and_perpendicular_lines.md).

(Longitud del cateto en un triángulo rectángulo)
**Length of the leg in a right triangle**: in a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $c$, and legs of lengths $a$ and $b$, $a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}$, $b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}$. This can be considered as a corollary of the pythagorean theorem.

(Ternas pitagóricas)
**Pythagorean triples**: groups of three counting numbers that can make the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. For example $3$, $4$, and $5$ are counting numbers that can build a right triangle because $5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25 = 9 + 16$. Multiples of a pythagorean triple are also pythagorean triples, for example $9$, $12$, and $15$, because $15^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 = 225 = 81 + 144$.

## Converse of the pythagorean theorem (Converso del teorema de Pitágoras)
[Ch08_S02](https://www.ck12.org/reader/reader-index.html#section/2932972/8.2/9549314)

In a triangle, if the longest side squared is equal to the sum of the other two sides squared, then the triangle is a right triangle, with the right angle being the angle opposite to the longest side.

> Proof of the converse of the pythagorean theorem
>
> Let $\triangle ABC$ have sides with lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, and let $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\angle C$ being the right angle which is the angle opposite to $c$, because any right triangle $\triangle DEF$ with hypotenuse $c$ and legs $a$ and $b$ has $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. $\blacksquare$

In a triangle $\triangle ABC$ with sides with lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$, then $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\angle C$ being the right angle opposite to the side $c$.

(Teorema de identificación de triángulos agudos)
**Identification of acute triangles theorem**: in a triangle, if the longest side squared is less than the sum of the other two sides squared, then the triangle is an acute triangle.

Let $\triangle DEF$ be a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $f$, such that $f^2 = a^2 + b^2$. $c$ is opposite to $\angle C$ and $f$ is opposite to $\angle F$. $\angle F$ is a right angle | Given |

In a triangle $\triangle ABC$ with sides with lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, and $c$ being the longest side, if $c^2 < a^2 + b^2$, then $\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle.

(Teorema de identificación de triángulos obtusos)
**Identification of obtuse triangles theorem**: in a triangle, if the longest side squared is greater than the sum of the other two sides squared, then the triangle is an obtuse triangle.

Let $\triangle DEF$ be a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $f$, such that $f^2 = a^2 + b^2$. $c$ is opposite to $\angle C$ and $f$ is opposite to $\angle F$. $\angle F$ is a right angle | Given |

In a triangle $\triangle ABC$ with sides with lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, and $c$ being the longest side, if $c^2 > a^2 + b^2$, then $\triangle ABC$ is an obtuse triangle.
