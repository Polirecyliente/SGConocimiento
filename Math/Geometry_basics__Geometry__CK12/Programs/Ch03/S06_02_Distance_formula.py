#T# the following code shows how to calculate the distance between two given points using the distance formula

#T# import the math module to do calculations
import math

#T# create two points, the distance between them will be calculated
p1 = (2, 1)
p2 = (7, 5)

#T# use the distance formula to calculate the distance between p1 and p2
d_p1p2 = math.sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0])**2 + (p2[1] - p1[1])) # 5.385164807134504
