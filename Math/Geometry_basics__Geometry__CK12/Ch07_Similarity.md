## Ratios and proportions (Ratios y proporciones)
[Ch07_S01](https://www.ck12.org/reader/reader-index.html#section/2932962/7.1/9549314)

A ratio is a division of two numbers measured in the same scale or unit of measure. The notation of ratios in particular, includes the use of the colon : symbol to replace the division symbol. So the ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ can be denoted as $a:b$. The ratio $a:b$ is read as $a$ to $b$ ($a$ a $b$).

In a ratio, the division operation is not actually made, for example the ratio $a:b$, in this ratio, if $a$ and $b$ are measured in type1 units, the ratio indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units of type1. The division is not performed. This allows writing ratios with more than two numbers, for example the ratio $a:b:c$ with $c$ also measured in type1 units, indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units, and also there are $a$ units per every $c$ units, and there are $b$ units per every $c$ units. When a ratio has more than two numbers, the fraction notation is not used, only the colon notation.

(Proporción)
**Proportion**: an equation in which two fractions (ratios or rates) are equated. Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero, then $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ is a proportion, it's read as $a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$ ($a$ es a $b$ como $c$ es a $d$).

(Producto cruzado)
**Cross product**: a proportion where the denominators have been multiplied in both sides, i.e. in the proportion $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, the cross product is $ad = cb$. This concept is used to test if a proportion is true without dividing.

(Teorema del producto cruzado)
**Cross product theorem | Cross-multiplication theorem**: Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero. If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = cb$.

> Proof of the cross product theorem
>
> Because of the multiplication property of equality, the equality $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ is maintained when multiplying both sides by $b$ and $d$, and so $ad = cb$. $\blacksquare$

(Converso del teorema del producto cruzado)
**Converse of the cross product theorem**: Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero. If $ad = cb$, then $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$.

> Proof of the converse of the cross product theorem
>
> Because of the division property of equality, the equality $ad = cb$ is maintained when dividing both sides by $b$ and $d$, and so $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$. $\blacksquare$

(Corolario)
**Corollary**: a theorem that is not proved, because it's too small and its true follows directly from another theorem or axiom, so it doesn't need to be proved.

(Corolarios del teorema del producto cruzado y su converso)
**Corollaries of the cross product theorem and its converse**: the cross product theorem and its converse have a few corollaries as follows.
