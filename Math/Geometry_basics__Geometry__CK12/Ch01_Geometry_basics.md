Geometry (Geometría) means the study of shapes and their spatial properties. Spatial refering to the space occupied by the shapes, or their location with regards to one another.

(Diagrama)
**Diagram**: a picture or drawing used to show shapes and their geometry.

(Punto)
**Point**: a single piece of space that has no extension, i.e. a shape with zero dimensions. Points are used to indicate locations in space, they are represented with dots in diagrams.

*Points in space*

The points shown in the *Points in space* image, are in the shape of blue dots. These shapes have an extension, a size, they are two dimensional, and they must be, otherwise they would be invisible if they truly were zero dimensional. These dots represent points with no dimensions.

Points are commonly labeled using a capital letter. The image shown has four points, namely $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.

(Línea)
**Line**: 

<!-- # TODO plane, postulate -->
