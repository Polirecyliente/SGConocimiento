Inductive reasoning means reasoning on the basis of observed patterns.

(Patrones numéricos)
**Number patterns**: patterns made with numbers. Discovering the pattern requires inductive reasoning.

> Example of a number pattern
>
> The numbers $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$... form a pattern, in this pattern, the next numbers are most likely $10$, $12$, $14$, etcetera.

A number pattern may be represented as an equation in two variables, one variable for position or term in the pattern (first, second, third, etcetera), and one variable for the value of the pattern in that position or term.

> Example of the equation of a number pattern
>
> Let the pattern be $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$..., let $n$ be the term of the pattern, and let $P_n$ be the value of the pattern in the term $n$, then
> $$P_n = 2n$$

(Conjetura)
**Conjecture**: an explanation of a pattern that has not been proven.

> Example of a conjecture
>
> In the pattern $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$... the conjecture is that the value of the next term is $10$, and that the equation of this pattern is $P_n = 2n$ where $n$ is the term and $P_n$ is the pattern value of the term $n$. But it can happen that the value of the next term is not $10$ but another value, for example it could be $15%.

(Contraejemplo)
**Counterexample**: in a pattern, a counterexample is a pattern value that disproves a given conjecture.

> Example of a counterexample
>
> In the pattern $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$..., if the conjecture is that the pattern value of the next term is $10$, then a counterexample would be that the pattern value of the next term was actually $15$, this disproves the conjecture.
