## Ratios and proportions (Ratios y proporciones)

A ratio is a division of two numbers measured in the same scale or unit of measure. The notation of ratios in particular, includes the use of the colon : symbol to replace the division symbol. So the ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ can be denoted as $a:b$. The ratio $a:b$ is read as $a$ to $b$ ($a$ a $b$).

In a ratio, the division operation is not actually made, for example the ratio $a:b$, in this ratio, if $a$ and $b$ are measured in type1 units, the ratio indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units of type1. The division is not performed. This allows writing ratios with more than two numbers, for example the ratio $a:b:c$ with $c$ also measured in type1 units, indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units, and also there are $a$ units per every $c$ units, and there are $b$ units per every $c$ units. When a ratio has more than two numbers, the fraction notation is not used, only the colon notation.

(Proporción)
**Proportion**: an equation in which two fractions (ratios or rates) are equated.

> Proportion
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero, then
> $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$
> This is a proportion, it's read as $a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$ ($a$ es a $b$ como $c$ es a $d$).

(Producto cruzado)
**Cross product**: a proportion where the denominators have been multiplied in both sides, i.e. in the proportion $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, the cross product is $ad = bc$. This concept is used to test if a proportion is true without dividing.

(Medios y extremos de una proporción)
**Means and extremes of a proportion**: any proportion $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ can be represented with ratios as $a:b = c:d$. Following this representation, the numbers $b$ and $c$ are called the means (they are in the center), and the numbers $a$ and $d$ are called the extremes (they are in the extremes). Using these definitions, it can be said that the cross product $ad = bc$ is the same as saying that the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means of the proportion.

(Proporción extendida)
**Extended proportion**: a proportion with more than one equal sign, which means that an extended proportion makes several fractions equal, e.g. $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} = \frac{e}{f}$.

(Proporción con porcentajes)
**Percent proportion**: a proportion in which one of the fractions is a percentage. Using terms from before, let $B$ be the base, $A$ the amount, then $\frac{A}{B} = \frac{p}{100}$, this means that the amount $A$ is to the base $B$ as $p$ is to $100$.

(Teorema del producto cruzado)
**Cross product theorem | Cross-multiplication theorem**: Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero. If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = bc$.

> Proof of the cross product theorem
>
> Because of the multiplication property of equality, the equality $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ is maintained when multiplying both sides by $b$ and $d$, and so $ad = bc$. $\blacksquare$

(Converso del teorema del producto cruzado)
**Converse of the cross product theorem**: Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero. If $ad = bc$, then $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$.

> Proof of the converse of the cross product theorem
>
> Because of the division property of equality, the equality $ad = bc$ is maintained when dividing both sides by $b$ and $d$, and so $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$. $\blacksquare$

(Corolarios del teorema del producto cruzado y su converso)
**Corollaries of the cross product theorem and its converse**: the cross product theorem and its converse have a few corollaries as follows.

> Corollaries of the cross product theorem and its converse
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ be nonzero real numbers, then
>
> If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{d}$.
> If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{d}{b} = \frac{c}{a}$.
> If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{d}{c} = \frac{b}{a}$.
> If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a + b}{b} = \frac{c + d}{d}$.
> If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{d}{c}$, so $\frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{c + d}{c}$.
> If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a - b}{b} = \frac{c - d}{d}$.

More corollaries can be deduced by adding or subtracting different numbers from both sides, and inverting the results.

## Similarity by AA (Similaridad por AA)

Similarity by AA means similarity by Angle-Angle (Similaridad (o semejanza) por Ángulo-Ángulo), so this similarity applies only to triangles.

## Similarity by SSS and SAS (Similaridad por LLL y LAL)

Similarity by SSS and SAS apply only to triangles, because of the definitions of SSS and SAS.


## Similarity transformations (Transformaciones geométricas de semejanza)

(Transformaciones geométricas)
**Geometric transformations**: procedures that take a figure and modify it in different ways. A transformed figure is commonly denoted by appending an apostrophe to its name, or the parts of its name. For example the figure $ABC$ can be transformed into the figure $A'B'C'$, read as figure $A$ prime $B$ prime $C$ prime (figura $A$ prima $B$ prima $C$ prima).

(Transformaciones rígidas)
**Rigid transformations**: geometric transformations over a figure, that do not change the size of the figure.

(Mapeo de un punto a otro)
**Mapping from a point to another**: mappings are a way to symbolize geometric transformations in the coordinate plane. Let the point $(x, y)$ be transformed into the point $(x', y')$, this can be denoted as $(x, y) \to (x', y')$, read as the point $(x, y)$ is mapped to $(x', y')$ (el punto $(x, y)$ es mapeado a $(x', y')$).

(Transformación de dilatación)
**Dilation transformation**: a non-rigid transformation that is used to increase or decrease the size of a figure, to 'dilate' it. The resulting figure of a dilation is similar to the original figure.

Dilations are defined with two parts, a center (centro) and an scale factor (factor de escala). The scale factor is defined the same as the definition already given (it's always greater than zero). The center is the point around which the dilation is performed, the point around which the scale factor is applied. This means that the farther away that the center of dilation is from the figure, the farther away that the resulting dilation is from the original.

(Dilatación de un punto)
**Point dilation**: the most basic dilation transformation. All dilations can be seen as point dilations applied to each point in a figure, and then connecting the dilated points with corresponding segments.

*Point dilation*

Given a figure consisting of a single point $B$, and a center of dilation $A$, the dilation is a point $C$, such that $AC = k AB$. In the image, $k = 3$.

(Dilataciones en el plano coordenado)
**Dilations in the coordinate plane**: a given 2D figure $Fig_1$ is composed of a set of points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane. Let $Fig_1$ be dilated with dilation center $C$ located at $(x_C, y_C)$, and scale factor $k$, into the dilation $Fig_1'$. The figure $Fig_1'$ is composed of a set of points $(x', y')$ in the coordinate plane, this can be denoted with the mapping $(x, y) \to (x', y')$. The point $(x', y')$ can be obtained from $C$ and $k$, as $(x', y') = (x_C + k (x - x_C), y_C + k (y - y_C))$. In the case where $C$ is the origin $(0, 0)$, the mapping becomes $(x', y') = (kx, ky)$.

*Dilations in the coordinate plane*

The point $D$ is the dilation center, the scale factor $k = 2.5$. As can be seen, the dilation is created by doing a point dilation to each original point individually.
