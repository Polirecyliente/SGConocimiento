## Math definitions (Definiciones de matemática)

(Variables)
**Variables**: the representation of quantities that can vary, written using letters of the alphabet, such as $a, b, c, x, y, z$.

(Constantes)
**Constants**: the representation of quantities that can not vary, that stay always with the same value, written using letters of the alphabet, such as $m, n$.

The use of a letter of the alphabet as a variable or as a constant is determined from the context, so the context must state which letters are variables and which are constants.

(Funciones)
**Functions**: an operation or set of operations done over a number or numbers, that returns a result. Operators (Operadores) act as functions, e.g. $a + b$ can be written as $sum(a,b)$, where the function $sum$ returns the sum of $a$, $b$.

(Símbolos algebraicos)
**Algebraic symbols**: numbers, variables, constants, operators, functions.

(Enunciado matemático)
**Math statement**: any math writing that can be read as a statement, with symbols, signs, numbers, operators, etcetera, e.g. math expressions, equations, inequalities, and other.

(Expresión matemática)
**Math expression**: a math statement of numbers, symbols, and operations together, such as $a (b + c) - d$

(Simplificación)
**Simplification**: do all possible operations in an expression. $4 \cdot 2 + 1$ can be simplified to $9$. Symbols of rational numbers are left as is, for example $\sqrt{\pi}$ should not be simplified further.

(Evaluar una expresión)
**Evaluate an expression**: this means substitute symbols for specific values and calculate the result, e.g. in $x + 7$ substitute $x$ for $4$ and calculate, $4 + 7 = 11$. Expressions without symbols are ready to be evaluated.

## Points (Puntos)

(Origen)
**Origin**: this is the point at 0 in all dimensions, e.g. in three dimensions, the origin is $(0, 0, 0)$.

(Coordenada de un punto)
**Coordinate of a point**: an ordered tuple of numbers indicating the location of the point. In the three dimensional tuple $(a, b, c)$, $a$ indicates the location of the point along the first dimension, $b$ indicates the location of the point along the second dimension, and $c$ indicates the location of the point along the third dimension. This pattern continues if the tuple has more numbers.

(Forma expandida de los números)
**Expanded form of the numbers**: numbers in a place value system can be shown in an expanded form, this expanded form is the sum of each of the digits in a given number multiplied by the base of the place value system to the power of its respective position, e.g. $345$ in expanded form is $3 \cdot 10^2 + 4 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0$

(Números opuestos)
**Opposite numbers**: pairs of numbers only differentiated by their sign, one is positive and the other one is negative, but their value is the same. Opposite numbers are obtained with the minus sign.

The opposite of $a$ is $-a$, so $-(a) = -a$. The opposite of $-a$ is $a$, so $-(-a) = a$.

(Función piso)
**Floor function**: a function that approximates a number to the nearest smaller integer. Denoted as $\lfloor x \rfloor$, where $x$ is the number being rounded, e.g. $\lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 2$, $\lfloor -2.5 \rfloor = -3$.

(Truncamiento)

## Equations and inequalities (Ecuaciones y desigualdades)

(Signo de igualdad)
**Equality sign**: this sign is $=$, the equal sign.

(Ecuación)

(Mayor que)
**Greater than**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is greater than the second. The operator is $>$, the greater than sign. $a > b$, read as $a$ greater than $b$ ($a$ mayor que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is greater than the value of $b$.

(Menor que)
**Less than**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is less than the second. The operator is $<$, the less than sign. $a < b$, read as $a$ less than $b$ ($a$ menor que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is less than the value of $b$.

(Mayor o igual que)
**Greater than or equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is greater than or equal to the second. The operator is $\ge$, the greater than or equal to sign. $a \ge b$, read as $a$ greater than or equal to $b$ ($a$ mayor o igual que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is greater than or equal to the value of $b$.

(Solución de una ecuación)
**Solution of an equation**: an equation that contains a variable can be solved by determining the value of the variable that makes the equation true, e.g. in $x + 7 = 11$, $x$ must be $4$ so that the equation is true, and $4$ is the solution of the equation. An equation with several variables has solution tuples, e.g. an equation with three variables, $x$, $y$, and $z$, has solution tuples of size three, such as $(4, 3, 8)$.

(Despejar una variable)
**Isolate a variable**: using properties of equality, to make a variable stand alone in one side of an equation, e.g. $4 + y/2 = x + 1 \Rightarrow y = 2x - 6$, here the variable $y$ is isolated.

(Propiedad aditiva de la igualdad)
**Addition property of equality**: adding a number to both sides of an equality preserves the equality. Given $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$.

(Propiedad sustractiva de la igualdad)
**Subtraction property of equality**: subtracting a number from both sides of an equality preserves the equality. Given $a = b$, then $a - c = b - c$.

(Propiedad multiplicativa de la igualdad)
**Multiplication property of equality**: multiplying a number to both sides of an equality preserves the equality. Given $a = b$, then $a \cdot c = b \cdot c$.

(Propiedad divisiva de la igualdad)
**Division property of equality**: dividing both sides of an equality by a nonzero number preserves the equality. Given $a = b$ and $c \ne 0$, then $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$.

## Addition of real numbers (Adición de números reales)

Addition is the operation of adding numbers together. Addition means starting at the end of the first number, and then moving the amount being added by the second number.

Addition is the inverse operation of subtraction. Given that addition means after the first number move the amount of the second, commutativity means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the end position is the same.

Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting its opposite (just as adding a positive number is the same as subtracting its opposite). If the number being added is positive then the addition moves in the positive direction, if the number being added is negative then the addition moves in the negative direction.

(Operador suma)
**Sum operator**: this operator is $+$, the plus sign.

(Notación de la suma)
**Addition notation**: the addition of $a$ and $b$ is $a + b = c$, read as $a$ plus $b$ ($a$ más $b$), $a$, $b$ are called the addends (sumandos), the result $c$ is called the sum (suma).

(Propiedad de identidad de la suma)
**Identity property of addition**: adding to zero doesn't change the number, $a + 0 = a$

(Identidad aditiva)
**Additive identity**: The number 0.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la suma)
**Commutative property of addition**: changing the order of the addends doesn't change the sum, $a + b = b + a$.

(Símbolo de sumatoria)
**Summation symbol**: the symbol $\sum_i$ that represents the sum of the elements of the set to which $i$ belongs, e.g. $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_i} = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$, where $1, 2, ..., n$ is the set of values of $i$ over which the summation is done.

## Subtraction of real numbers (Sustracción de números reales)

Subtraction is the operation of subtracting a number from another. Subtraction means starting at the end of the first number, and then moving in the opposite direction the amount of units being subtracted by the second number.

Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition. Subtraction is not commutative.

Subtracting a negative number means moving opposite to its direction, i.e. moving in the positive direction. In $a - (-b)$ the expression $- (-b)$ subtracts negative $b$, so moving opposite to negative $b$ means adding positive $b$, and $a - (-b) = a + b$.

(Operador resta)
**Subtraction operator**: this operator is $-$, the minus sign.

(Notación de la resta)
**Subtraction notation**: the subtraction of $a$ from $b$ is $b - a = c$, read as $b$ minus $a$ ($b$ menos $a$), $b$ is called the minuend (minuendo), $a$ is called the subtrahend (sustraendo), the result $c$ is called the difference (diferencia)

## Multiplication of real numbers (Multiplicación de números reales)

Multiplication is the operation of multiplying numbers together. Multiplication means the repeated addition of a number with itself, the amount of repeated additions is the other number in the operation.

Multiplication is the inverse operation of division. Given that multiplication means the repeated addition of the first number with itself a number of times equal to the second number, this means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the final repeated addition is the same.

When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, it changes the sign of the other number, so multiplying or dividing a negative number by another negative number results in a positive number, and multiplying or dividing a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.

In a multiplication operation, if the amount of repeated additions is negative, then this means repeated addition with each addition done in the opposite direction. For example, $4 \cdot -3 = -4 -4 -4$, each addition is done in the opposite direction of $4$, and in $-4 \cdot -3 = 4 + 4 + 4$, each addition is done in the opposite direction of $-4$.

(Operador multiplicación)
**Multiplication operator**: this operator is $\times$, the times sign. Another is $\cdot$, the dot sign. Another is $()$, the parentheses signs.

(Notación de la multiplicación)
**Multiplication notation**: the multiplication of $a$ and $b$ is $a \cdot b = c$, read as $a$ times $b$ ($a$ veces $b$), $a$, $b$ are called the factors (factores), the result $c$ is called the product (producto).

(Propiedad anulativa de la multiplicación)
**Multiplication property of zero**: the product of any number multiplied by 0, is 0, $a \cdot 0 = 0$.

(Propiedad modulativa de la multiplicación)
**Identity property of multiplication**: the product of any number multiplied by 1, is the number itself, $a \cdot 1 = a$.

(Identidad multiplicativa | elemento neutro | elemento identidad)
**Multiplicative identity**: The number 1.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la multiplicación)
**Commutative property of multiplication**: changing the order of the factors doesn't change the product, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.

(Multiplicación por -1)
**Multiplication by -1**: a number multiplied by $-1$ results in its opposite, $-1 \cdot a = -a$. Using the definition of multiplication, multiplying $a$ by $-1$ is the same as adding $a$ one time in its opposite direction, which is $-a$, the opposite of $a$.

(Paradigma de la multiplicación y división)
**Multiplication and division paradigm**: multiplication and division both deal with three concepts: a set of elements, groups of elements, and the size of said groups. Each of this concepts is associated with a number, the total number of elements, the amount of groups, and the size of each group.

Multiplication returns the total number of elements as the product of the amount of groups by the size of each group. For example, $5$ groups of size $4$, have a total number of elements of $5 \cdot 4 = 20$, and $4$ groups each with $5$ elements, have a total number of elements of $4 \cdot 5 = 20$. By itself, the total number of elements remains the same, $20$.

In multiplication, the amount of groups is interchangeable with the size of each group, so a multiplication can be interpreted as the amount of groups times their size, or as the size of the groups times the amount of groups, both interpretations are valid for any single multiplication.

Division has a similar behavior, the total number of elements is the dividend, but then, the divisor can be any of the other two numbers. The divisor can be the amount of groups, or the size of each group, and the quotient is the other number. For example, $24 \div 8 = 3$ means, from the $24$ total elements, with groups of size $8$, then there are $3$ groups, but $24 \div 8 = 3$ also means that from the $24$ total elements, with $8$ groups, each will have a size of $3$. Both conclusions are arrived via repeated subtraction.

The interpretation of $24 \div 8 = 3$ as $24$ elements divided in $8$ groups have a group size of $3$, means that there are $3$ elements per each $1$ group, so $24 \div 8 = 3 \div 1$, in words it could be read as, there are $24$ elements each $8$ groups, or there are $3$ elements each $1$ group.

## Division of real numbers (División de números reales)

Division is the operation of dividing a first number by a second number. Division means the repeated subtraction of the second number from the first number until reaching 0, the amount of repeated subtractions is the result of the operation.

Division is the inverse operation of Multiplication. Division is not commutative.

If the amount of repeated subtractions is negative, then this means repeated subtraction with each subtraction done in the opposite direction. For example, $24 \div -8 = -3$ so the number $-8$ is subtracted $-3$ times from $24$, i.e. $-8$ is subtracted three times in its opposite direction to reach 0 starting at 24. In $-24 \div -8 = 3$ the amount of repeated subtractions is positive, so $-8$ is subtracted directly from $-24$ three times to reach 0.

(Operador división)
**Division operator**: this operator is $\div$, the division sign. Another is $/$, the slash sign. Another is $\text{---}$, the horizontal line sign.

(Notación de la división)
**Division notation**: the division of $b$ over $a$ is $\frac{b}{a} = c$, read as $b$ divided by $a$ ($b$ dividido $a$), $b$ is called the dividend (dividendo), $a$ is called the divisor (divisor), the result $c$ is called the quotient (cociente).

(Propiedad modulativa de la división)
**Identity property of division**: the quotient of any number divided by 1, is the number itself, $\frac{a}{1} = a$.

(Identidad divisiva)
**Divisive identity**: The number 1.

(Propiedad del cociente uno de la división)
**Division property of quotient one**: any non zero number divided by itself gives a quotient of 1, $\frac{a}{a} = 1$.

(Propiedades del cero en la división)
**Division properties of zero**: zero divided by any nonzero number is zero, $\frac{0}{a} = 0$. Division by zero is undefined, $\frac{a}{0}\ is\ undef$.

(División por -1)
**Division by -1**: a number divided by $-1$ results in its opposite, $a \div -1 = -a$. Using the definition of division, dividing $a$ by $-1$ is the same as subtracting $-1$ from $a$ until reaching 0, which is $-a$ times, the opposite of $a$.

(Residuo | Resto)
**Remainder**: in division, this is the number that is left over after doing the repeated subtraction, if any. In $\frac{a}{b} = q + \frac{r}{b}$, $a$, $b$ are numbers with $b$ being nonzero, $q$ is the quotient, and $r$ is the remainder.

## Exponentiation of real numbers (Exponenciación de números reales)

(Notación exponencial)
**Exponential notation**: used in expressions where a number is multiplied by itself several times, for example, $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$ is written as $2^4$. In general $a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a = a^n$, where the value $n$ is the amount of times that $a$ is multiplied by itself.

Using the shown symbols, the exponential notation is read as $a$ to the $n$-th power ($a$ a la $n$-ésima potencia), also read as $a$ to the power of $n$ ($a$ a la $n$). The operation itself is read as raise $a$ to the $n$-th power (elevar $a$ a la $n$-ésima potencia), also read as raise $a$ to the power of $n$ (elevar $a$ a la $n$).

(Potenciación)
**Exponentiation**: the operation of raising a number to a given power, e.g. $a^n$.

(Expresión exponencial en forma expandida)
**Exponential expression in expanded form**: $a^n$ can be represented in expanded form as $a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot ... \cdot a$ where $a$ is multiplied by itself $n$ times.

(Números al cuadrado)
**Squared numbers**: when a number is raised to the power of 2, it is said that the result is a squared number, e.g. $3$ to the power of $2$ is $9$, or $3$ squared is $9$ ($3$ al cuadrado es $9$).

(Números al cubo)
**Cubed numbers**: when a number is raised to the power of 3, it is said that the result is a cubed number, e.g. $5$ to the power of $3$ is $125$, or $5$ cubed is $125$ ($5$ al cubo es $125$).

## Order of operations (Orden de las operaciones)

The order in which to execute the operations. In $5 + \frac{10}{2}$, the result is $10$ if division is done first, but the result is $7.5$ if addition is done first. This can be modified with grouping symbols.

(Signos de agrupación)
**Grouping symbols**: symbols that act as operators by grouping algebraic symbols. The grouped symbols are operated together. The grouping symbols serve to make explicit the order of operations.

(Paréntesis)
**Parentheses**: this operator is $()$, the parentheses signs. $8(14 - 8)$ returns $48$.

(Corchetes)
**Brackets**: this operator is $[]$, the brackets signs. $21 - 3[2 + 4(9 - 8)]$ returns $3$.

(Llaves)
**Braces**: this operator is $\{\}$, the braces signs. $24 \div \{13 - 2[(6 - 5) + 4]\}$ returns $8$.

(PEMDAS)
**PEMDAS**: acronym of Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. This dictates the standard order of operations when there are no parentheses, or grouping symbols in general. Multiplication and division have the same relevance, so they can be switched in order, same with addition and subtraction.

## Properties of real numbers (Propiedades de los números reales)

(Valor absoluto)
**Absolute value**: the distance between 0 and a given number, it's always positive and it's the same for any number and its opposite. For a given number $a$, its absolute value is denoted as $\lvert a \rvert$, e.g. $\lvert 5 \rvert = \lvert -5 \rvert = 5$.

## Multiples and factors of integers (Múltiplos y factores de los enteros)

A given integer is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (i.e. the first digit, minus the second, plus the third, minus the fourth, etc.) is divisible by 11.

(Factores de un número)
**Factors of a number**: in a given integer, its factors are the integers that multiplied together produce it. An integer can have several different sets of factors, e.g. $12$ has different sets of factors like $3$, $4$, also $2$, $6$, or $2$, $3$, $2$, or others.

(Pares de factores)
**factor pairs**: factors can always be presented in pairs, because at least two integers are required to be multiplied together in order to produce a given integer. In the example of $12 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$, with factor pairs the equation would be $12 = 2 \cdot 6$ or $12 = 3 \cdot 4$.

(Números primos)
**Prime numbers**: each of the integers with only 2 different factors, the number 1 and the integer itself.

(Mínimo común múltiplo)
**Least common multiple**: the smallest common multiple of a given set of at least two integers.

The least common multiple of two integers can be calculated using their prime factors. The least common multiple of two integers is the product of all their unique prime factors, each raised to the power of their maximum multiplicity.

For example, to find the least common multiple of $12$ and $18$, the prime factors of $12$ are $2$, $2$, $3$, and the prime factors of $18$ are $2$, $3$, $3$. The least common multiple is $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 36$, the number $2$ has a maximum multiplicity of $2$ (in $12$), and $3$ has a maximum multiplicity of $2$ (in $18$).

(Máximo común divisor)
**Greatest common divisor**: the biggest common divisor of a given set of at least two integers.

In this use of the term "divisor", it is also a factor of the set of numbers. That's why sometimes this is also called greatest common factor (Máximo factor común).

The greatest common divisor of two integers can be calculated using their prime factors. The greatest common divisor of two integers is the product of their common prime factors, each raised to the power of their minimum multiplicity.

## Algebra definitions (Definiciones de álgebra)

(Coeficiente)
**Coefficient**: the numeric constant that multiplies the variable(s) in a term. If a term has no variables then the coefficient is the term itself. If a variable has no numeric constant then the implied coefficient is 1. For example, in $3a + 7 + x^2$, the coefficients are $3$, $7$, and $1$, respectively.

(Términos semejantes)
**Like terms**: terms that can be added together directly, like terms can only differ from each other in the coefficient, so their symbol(s) (variable or constant) has to be the same, e.g. $3x$ and $4x$ are like terms, they may be added (or subtracted) directly.

(Reducción de términos semejantes)
**Combining like terms | Combine like terms**: simplification in which like terms are combined, i.e. they are added together according to their sign, e.g. $3x + 4x$ can be combined as $7x$, $3x - 4x$ can be combined as $-x$.
