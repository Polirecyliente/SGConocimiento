#### Exponentiation of real numbers (Exponenciación de números reales)

(Base y exponente)
**Base and exponent**: in the operation $a^n$, $a$ is called the base and $n$ is called the exponent.

(Expresión exponencial en forma expandida)
**Exponential expression in expanded form**: $a^n$ can be represented in expanded form as $a a a \ldots a$ where $a$ is multiplied by itself $n$ times.

(Números al cuadrado)
**Squared numbers**: when a number is raised to the power of 2, it is said that the result is a squared number, e.g. $3$ to the power of $2$ is $9$, or $3$ squared is $9$ ($3$ al cuadrado es $9$).

(Cuadrado perfecto)
**Perfect square**: any whole number that is the square of an integer. For example $9$ is the perfect square of $3$, because $3^2 = 9$ and $\sqrt{9} = 3$.

(Números al cubo)
**Cubed numbers**: when a number is raised to the power of 3, it is said that the result is a cubed number, e.g. $5$ to the power of $3$ is $125$, or $5$ cubed is $125$ ($5$ al cubo es $125$).

(Radicación de números)
**Taking a root of a number**: the exponentiation operation using as exponent the reciprocal of an integer, e.g. $a^{1/7}$ in which the exponent is the reciprocal of $7$, this is read as taking the seventh root of $a$ (sacar la raíz séptima de $a$).

(Signo de radical)
**Radical sign**: The symbol around $n$ in $\sqrt{n}$ is the radical sign, it acts as a grouping symbol for the expression inside it. $\sqrt{n} = n^{1/2}$, and $\sqrt[7]{n} = n^{1/7}$, in general $\sqrt[k]{n} = n^{1/k}$.

(Raíz cuadrada)
**Square root**: given two numbers $m$, $n$, such that $m = n^2$, then $n$ is the square root of $m$, $n = \sqrt{m}$. Squared numbers can be seen as squares in a 2D grid. Let $m$ be the area of a given square, then $n$ is the measure of its side's length.

(Raíz cuadrada principal)
**Principal square root**: since any square root can be negative or positive, because $n^2 = (-n)^2 = m$, so both $n$ and $-n$ are roots of $m$, only one is chosen as the square root of $m$, this is the positive value $n$, named the principal square root of $m$, $\sqrt{m}$ stands for $n$.

(Producto de potencias de igual base)
**Product property of exponents**: the product of two equal bases, each with their exponent, is equal to the base raised to the sum of the exponents, $a^m a^n = a^{m + n}$.

(Potencia de una potencia)
**Power property of exponents**: the result of raising a base to an exponent and then raising that power to another exponent, is equal to the base raised to the power of the product of the exponents, ${(a^m)}^n = a^{m n}$.

(Producto de potencias con el mismo exponente)
**Product to a power property of exponents**: the product of two bases with the same exponent, is equal to the product of the bases raised to the power of the exponent, $a^n b^n = {(a b)}^n$.

(Cociente de potencias de la misma base)
**Quotient property of exponents**: the quotient of two exponents that have the same base, is equal to the base raised to the power of the exponent in the numerator minus the exponent in the denominator, $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}$.

(Exponente negativo)
**Negative exponent**: the reciprocal of the base raised to the power of the exponent, $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$.

(Exponente cero)
**Zero exponent**: a nonzero base raised to the power of zero is equal to one, $a^0 = 1$ such that $a \ne 0$.

(Potencia de un cociente)
**Quotient to a power property of exponents**: the quotient of two bases with the same exponent, is equal to the quotient of the bases raised to the power of the exponent, $\frac{a^n}{b^n} = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n$.

#### Order of operations (Orden de las operaciones)

The order in which to execute the operations. In $5 + \frac{10}{2}$, the result is $10$ if division is done first, but the result is $7.5$ if addition is done first. This can be modified with grouping symbols.

(Signos de agrupación)
**Grouping symbols**: symbols that act as operators by grouping algebraic symbols. The grouped symbols are operated together. The grouping symbols serve to make explicit the order of operations.

(Paréntesis)
**Parentheses**: this operator is $()$, the parentheses signs. $8(14 - 8)$ returns $48$.

(Corchetes)
**Brackets**: this operator is $[]$, the brackets signs. $21 - 3[2 + 4(9 - 8)]$ returns $3$.

(Llaves)
**Braces**: this operator is $\{\}$, the braces signs. $24 \div \{13 - 2[(6 - 5) + 4]\}$ returns $8$.

(PEMDAS)
**PEMDAS**: acronym of Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. This dictates the standard order of operations when there are no parentheses, or grouping symbols in general. Multiplication and division have the same relevance, so they can be switched in order, same with addition and subtraction.

### Properties of real numbers (Propiedades de los números reales)

(Valor absoluto)
**Absolute value**: the distance between 0 and a given number, it's always positive and it's the same for any number and its opposite. For a given number $a$, its absolute value is denoted as $\lvert a \rvert$, e.g. $\lvert 5 \rvert = \lvert -5 \rvert = 5$.

(Ternas pitagóricas)
**Pythagorean triples**: groups of three counting numbers that can make the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. For example $3$, $4$, and $5$ are counting numbers that can build a right triangle because $5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 25 = 9 + 16$. Multiples of a pythagorean triple are also pythagorean triples, for example $9$, $12$, and $15$, because $15^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 = 225 = 81 + 144$.

### Multiples and factors of integers (Múltiplos y factores de los enteros)

(Múltiplos de un número)
**Multiples of an number**: given an integer, its multiples are the result of multiplying it by any of the counting numbers, so an integer has infinite multiples. The smallest multiple (in absolute value) is the integer itself.

(Divisibilidad)
**Divisibility**: if a given integer $b$ is multiple of another $a$, then $b$ is divisible by $a$, because $\frac{b}{a}$ is an integer. All the multiples of $a$ are divisible by $a$.

(Números pares)
**Even numbers**: 0 and the multiples of 2.

(Números impares)
**Odd numbers**: the integers that are not even numbers.

(Pruebas de divisibilidad)
**Divisibility tests**: a quick test made to check if an integer is divisible by another. The following are the divisibility tests of the first positive integers.

A given integer is divisible by 2 if its last digit is an even number.
A given integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
A given integer is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4.
A given integer is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
A given integer is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by 2 and 3.
A given integer is divisible by 7 if its last digit is doubled and then subtracted from the rest of the integer, and the result of that is divisible by 7.
A given integer is divisible by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8.
A given integer is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
A given integer is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.
A given integer is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (i.e. the first digit, minus the second, plus the third, minus the fourth, etc.) is divisible by 11.

(Factores de un número)
**Factors of a number**: in a given integer, its factors are the integers that multiplied together produce it. An integer can have several different sets of factors, e.g. $12$ has different sets of factors like $3$, $4$, also $2$, $6$, or $2$, $3$, $2$, or others.

(Pares de factores)
**factor pairs**: factors can always be presented in pairs, because at least two integers are required to be multiplied together in order to produce a given integer. In the example of $12 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$, with factor pairs the equation would be $12 = 2 \cdot 6$ or $12 = 3 \cdot 4$.

(Números primos)
**Prime numbers**: each of the integers with only 2 different factors, the number 1 and the integer itself.

(Números compuestos)
**Composite numbers**: the numbers that are not prime, i.e. the integers that have more than one factor pair.

(Factores primos)
**prime factors**: the set of prime numbers that multiplied together produce a given integer. Integers can be represented as the product of prime factors.

(Descomposición en factores primos)
**Prime factorization**: the process of finding the prime factors of a number.

(Multiplicidad de un factor primo)
**Multiplicity of a prime factor**: the amount of times that a prime factor of a given number is repeated, e.g. in the number $60$ the prime factors are $2$, $2$, $3$, $5$, the number $2$ has a multiplicity of $2$, the number $3$ has a multiplicity of $1$, and the number $5$ has a multiplicity of $1$.

(Múltiplos comunes)
**Common multiples**: given a set of at least two integers, the common multiples are the numbers that are multiples of all the integers in the set.

(Mínimo común múltiplo)
**Least common multiple**: the smallest common multiple of a given set of at least two integers.

The least common multiple of two integers can be calculated using their prime factors. The least common multiple of two integers is the product of all their unique prime factors, each raised to the power of their maximum multiplicity.

For example, to find the least common multiple of $12$ and $18$, the prime factors of $12$ are $2$, $2$, $3$, and the prime factors of $18$ are $2$, $3$, $3$. The least common multiple is $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 36$, the number $2$ has a maximum multiplicity of $2$ (in $12$), and $3$ has a maximum multiplicity of $2$ (in $18$).

(Mínimo común denominador)
**Least common denominator**: the least common multiple of the denominators from a set of at least two fractions.

(Máximo común divisor)
**Greatest common divisor**: the biggest common divisor of a given set of at least two integers.

In this use of the term "divisor", it is also a factor of the set of numbers. That's why sometimes this is also called greatest common factor (Máximo factor común).

The greatest common divisor of two integers can be calculated using their prime factors. The greatest common divisor of two integers is the product of their common prime factors, each raised to the power of their minimum multiplicity.

## Logic definitions (Definiciones de lógica)

(Razonamiento inductivo)
**Inductive reasoning**: inductive reasoning means reasoning on the basis of observed patterns.

(Patrones numéricos)
**Number patterns**: patterns made with numbers. Discovering the pattern requires inductive reasoning. For example, the numbers $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$... form a pattern, in this pattern, the next numbers are most likely $10$, $12$, $14$, etcetera.

A number pattern may be represented as an equation in two variables, one variable for the position or term in the pattern (first, second, third, etcetera), and one variable for the value of the pattern in that position or term. Continuing the example, let the pattern be $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$..., let $n$ be the term of the pattern, and let $P_n$ be the value of the pattern in the term $n$, then $P_n = 2n$.

(Conjetura)
**Conjecture**: an unproven explanation of a pattern. For example, in the pattern $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$... the conjecture is that the value of the next term is $10$, and that the equation of this pattern is $P_n = 2n$ where $n$ is the term and $P_n$ is the pattern value of the term $n$. But it can happen that the value of the next term is not $10$ but another value, for example it could be $15$.

(Contraejemplo)
**Counterexample**: in a pattern, a counterexample is a pattern value that disproves a given conjecture. For example, in the pattern $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$..., if the conjecture is that the pattern value of the next term is $10$, then a counterexample would be that the pattern value of the next term was actually $15$, this disproves the conjecture.

(Razonamiento deductivo)
**Deductive reasoning**: deductive reasoning means reasoning on the basis of given facts. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p \to q$. Given the fact that $p$ happens, the conclusion is that $q$ happens or will happen. Concluding that $q$ happens is a deduction, because it's a conclusion that was arrived to by reasoning on the basis of the given facts $p$ and $p \to q$.

(Demostración por contradicción)
**Indirect proof**: type of proof of a conditional in which the consequent is negated, and by deduction a contradiction is found, which means that the consequent is true.

### Propositional logic (Lógica proposicional)

Propositional logic is a branch of logic that condenses events and logical statements into symbols to operate over them and create propositions, which are logical statements themselves. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events or logical statements, then those symbols, $p$ and $q$, represent said events or logical statements. Logical operations can be made over $p$ and $q$.

(Valor de verdad de una proposición o evento)
**Truth value of a statement or event**: value that results from a statement, or that is assigned to an event. The value $1$ means true, and the value $0$ means false. An event can be assigned a truth value, $1$ if the event happens, and $0$ if the event does not happen. A statement results in a truth value, $1$ if the statement is true, and $0$ if the statement is false. For example let $p$ be the event 'I am healthy today', assigning it a truth value of $1$ means that $p$ happens, and assigning it a truth value of $0$ means that $p$ does not happen. Truth values are also called logical values (valores lógicos).

(Proposiciones condicionales)
**Conditional statements**: conditional statements are also called if-then statements, they are called in these ways because they put an event named conclusion (conclusión) to happen on the condition that another event named hypothesis (hipótesis) happens. In a conditional statement if the hypothesis happens then the conclusion happens. The hypothesis is also known as the antecedent (antecedente), and the conclusion is also known as the consequent (consecuente).

(Partes de una proposición condicional)
**Parts of a conditional statement**: a conditional statement has three parts, the hypothesis, the conclusion, and the connector between them. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p$ is the hypothesis of a conditional statement, and $q$ is the conclusion of the same conditional statement, then $p \to q$ denotes the conditional statement. It is read as if $p$ then $q$ (si $p$ entonces $q$), also read as $p$ implies $q$ ($p$ implica $q$).

For example, let $p$ be the event 'I am healthy today', and $q$ be the event 'I work today', then the conditional statement $p \to q$ means that 'if I am healthy today then I work today'.

(Negación lógica)
**Logical negation**: an operator used to negate an event. A negated event means that its negation happens. For example, let $p$ be an event, then its negation is $\neg p$. As a particular example of negation, let $p$ be the event 'I am healthy today', then $\neg p$ means the event 'I am not healthy today', which asserts that the negation of the event $p$ happens.

(Converso de una proposición)
**Converse of a statement**: the result of switching the order of the events of the statement. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p \to q$, then the converse is $q \to p$.

(Inverso de una proposición)
**Inverse of a statement**: the result of negating the events of the statement. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p \to q$, then the inverse is $\neg p \to \neg q$.

(Contrapositivo de una proposición | Contrarrecíproco de una proposición)
**Contrapositive of a statement**: the result of negating and switching the order of the events of the statement. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p \to q$, then the contrapositive is $\neg q \to \neg p$.

(Proposiciones lógicas equivalentes)
**Logically equivalent statements**: two distinct statements with the same events that lead to the same truth values. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p \to q$, then its contrapositive is logically equivalent, i.e. $\neg q \to \neg p$ has the same logical meaning as $p \to q$.

As a concrete example, let $p$ be the event 'I am healthy today', and $q$ be the event 'I work today', then the conditional statement $p \to q$ means that 'if I am healthy today then I work today'. On the other hand, $\neg q$ means 'I don't work today', and for this to happen, $\neg p$ 'I am not healthy today' must also happen, so $\neg q \to \neg p$.

The converse and the inverse of a conditional statement are not necessarily true. In the example, the converse $q \to p$ means 'if I work today, then I am healthy today', but this is not logically guaranteed, because it can be that 'I work today' and 'I am not healthy today'. The statement $p \to q$ does not invalidate the statement $\neg p \to q$, both can be true at the same time. For this same reason the inverse $\neg p \to \neg q$ is not necessarily true. Only the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the conditional statement. But the converse and the inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent to each other as well, because one is the contrapositive of the other.

(Proposición bicondicional)
**Biconditional statement**: a logical statement with a hypothesis that conditionates a conclusion, in which the conclusion conditionates the hypothesis. In a biconditional statement, the conclusion can be used as the hypothesis, and the hypothesis can be used as the conclusion. For example, let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that each is a condition for the other to happen, then $p \leftrightarrow q$ denotes the biconditional statement. It is read as $p$ if and only if $q$ ($p$ sí y solo sí $q$).

The converse, inverse, and contrapositive of a biconditional statement are logically equivalent to each other. $p \leftrightarrow q$ implies $q \leftrightarrow p$ and also $\neg p \leftrightarrow \neg q$ and $\neg q \leftrightarrow \neg p$.

As a particular example, let $p$ be the event 'I am healthy today', and $q$ be the event 'I work today', then the biconditional statement $p \leftrightarrow q$ means that 'I am healthy today if and only if I work today'.

(Ley de separación)
**Law of detachment**: given two facts as true, that there exists a conditional statement and that the hypothesis of said conditional statement happens, the conclusion of the conditional statement can be deduced as a third true fact with no need for any other information. Let $p$, $q$ be two events, let $p$ be true, and let the conditional $p \to q$ be also true, then $q$ is true by deduction. The law of detachment is also known as modus ponendo ponens, which is latin for the mode that by affirming affirms.

The law of detachment is written as follows.

$$\begin{gathered}
p \to q\\
p\\
\therefore q
\end{gathered}$$

The $\therefore$ symbol is the therefore symbol, read as therefore (por lo tanto). The statements before the $\therefore$ are assumed true, and the statements after the $\therefore$ are deduced to be true.

(Ley contrarrecíproca)
**Law of contrapositive**: given two facts as true, that there exists a conditional statement and that the consecuent negated happens, then the negation of the antecedent can be deduced as a third true fact. Let $p$, $q$ be two events, let the conditional $p \to q$ be true and let $\neg q$ be also true, then $\neg p$ is true by deduction.

The law of contrapositive is written as follows.

$$\begin{gathered}
p \to q\\
\neg q\\
\therefore \neg p
\end{gathered}$$

This law is true because the contrapositive of a conditional is logically equivalent to said conditional.

(Ley del silogismo)
**Law of syllogism**: a chain of conditionals can be made, so that the consequent of one conditional is the antecedent of the next conditional. Given a chain of conditionals, one extra conditional can be deduced, namely if the first antecedent in the chain is true, then the last consequent in the chain is true.

The law of syllogism is written as follows.
Let $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ events, then

$$\begin{gathered}
p \to q\\
q \to r\\
r \to s\\
\therefore p \to s
\end{gathered}$$

For that matter, several other conditionals could be deduced if needed, such as $p \to r$ and $q \to s$.

(Conjunción lógica)
**Logical conjunction**: the operation over two logical statements that returns a logical value of true if both logical statements are true. This is also known as the AND operation, because the first logical statement and the second must be true for the conjunction of them to be true. Let $p$, $q$ be two events, their conjunction is denoted as $p \land q$. The symbol $\land$ is the AND operator, $p \land q$ is read as $p$ and $q$ ($p$ y $q$).

(Disyunción lógica)
**Logical disjunction**: the operation over two logical statements that returns a logical value of true if either one or both logical statements are true. This is also known as the OR operation, because the first or the second logical statement or both can be true for the disjunction of them to be true. Let $p$, $q$ be two events, their disjunction is denoted as $p \lor q$. The symbol $\lor$ is the OR operator, $p \lor q$ is read as $p$ or $q$ ($p$ o $q$).

(Tablas de verdad)
**Truth tables**: tables made to organize the logical values of logical statements. They serve to compare side by side the logical values that result after applying different logical operators to logical statements and events. To indicate true and false, truth tables commonly use $1$ for true and $0$ for false, or also $T$ for true and $F$ for false. Truth tables consider all the possible combinations of logical values. 

The following is a truth table for the statement $p \land (\neg q \lor r)$.

| $p$ | $q$ | $r$ | $\neg q$ | $\neg q \lor r$ | $p \land (\neg q \lor r)$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :------: | :-------------: | :-----------------------: |
| $1$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$      | $1$             | $1$                       |
| $1$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$      | $0$             | $0$                       |
| $1$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$      | $1$             | $1$                       |
| $1$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$      | $1$             | $1$                       |
| $0$ | $1$ | $1$ | $0$      | $1$             | $0$                       |
| $0$ | $1$ | $0$ | $0$      | $0$             | $0$                       |
| $0$ | $0$ | $1$ | $1$      | $1$             | $0$                       |
| $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $1$      | $1$             | $0$                       |
*Truth table for the $p \land (\neg q \lor r)$ statement*

### Logic fallacies (Falacias lógicas)

(Falacia lógica)
**Logic fallacy**: a set of logical statements that are wrong or misconstrued.

(Falacia del converso)
**Fallacy of the converse**: also known as affirming the consequent (afirmación del consecuente), this fallacy states that given two true facts, a conditional statement and the consequent of said conditional, then the antecedent is deduced as being true.

Let $p$, $q$ be two events, then

$$\begin{gathered}
p \to q\\
q\\
\therefore p
\end{gathered}$$

These logical statements are wrong, because if $p \to q$ is true and $q$ is true, then $p$ may or may not be true. It could be the case that $\neg p \to q$.

## Algebra definitions (Definiciones de álgebra)

(Expresión algebraica)
**Algebraic expression**: an expression that uses symbols, it may or may not represent constant values as symbols too, e.g. $x + 7$ or $x + a$.

(Términos algebraicos)
**Algebraic terms**: each of the parts of an algebraic expression separated by a plus or minus, so numbers and symbols multiplied together count as a term, e.g. in $3a + 7 + x^2$ there are three terms, $3a$, $7$, and $x^2$.

(Coeficiente)
**Coefficient**: the numeric constant that multiplies the variable(s) in a term. If a term has no variables then the coefficient is the term itself. If a variable has no numeric constant then the implied coefficient is 1. For example, in $3a + 7 + x^2$, the coefficients are $3$, $7$, and $1$, respectively.

(Términos semejantes)
**Like terms**: terms that can be added together directly, like terms can only differ from each other in the coefficient, so their symbol(s) (variable or constant) has to be the same, e.g. $3x$ and $4x$ are like terms, they may be added (or subtracted) directly.

(Reducción de términos semejantes)
**Combining like terms | Combine like terms**: simplification in which like terms are combined, i.e. they are added together according to their sign, e.g. $3x + 4x$ can be combined as $7x$, $3x - 4x$ can be combined as $-x$.

### Algebra theorems (Teoremas de álgebra)

(Teorema del producto cruzado)
**Cross product theorem | Cross-multiplication theorem**: Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero. If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = bc$.

(Converso del teorema del producto cruzado)
**Converse of the cross product theorem**: Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be real numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero. If $ad = bc$, then $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$.

(Corolarios del teorema del producto cruzado y su converso)
**Corollaries of the cross product theorem and its converse**: the cross product theorem and its converse have a few corollaries as follows. Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ be nonzero real numbers, then:

If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{d}$.
If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{d}{b} = \frac{c}{a}$.
If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{d}{c} = \frac{b}{a}$.
If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a + b}{b} = \frac{c + d}{d}$.
If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{d}{c}$, so $\frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{c + d}{c}$.
If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $\frac{a - b}{b} = \frac{c - d}{d}$.

More corollaries can be deduced by adding or subtracting different numbers from both sides, and inverting the results.

### Linear equations (Ecuaciones lineales)

A linear equation is an equation in which the variables have an exponent of $1$.

Linear equations can start with variable terms on both sides. When equations have variables and constants on both sides, the properties of equality can be used to move the variables and put them in one side if needed. For example, if a variable is dividing a number, it can be passed to the other side by using the multiplication property of equality, multiplying both sides by the variable.

(Lado para variables de una ecuación)
**Variable side of an equation**: A side of an equation that can be arbitrarily chosen to hold variables, or a single variable, in order to isolate it and find its value.

(Lado para constantes de una ecuación)
**Constant side of an equation**: The other side of an equation that is produced when choosing a variable side.

(Ecuación lineal en una variable)
**Linear equation in one variable**: linear equation in which there is only one variable. These equations can be simplified by using the properties of equality to create a variable side and a constant side.

Let $a$, $b$, be numbers, $x$ be a variable, then $a x = b$ is the basic form of a linear equation.

Every linear equation in one variable can be simplified through the use of the properties of equality, to leave it in the form $a x = b$. The side $a x$ is the variable side, and the side $b$ is the constant side.

(Combinar términos variables)
**Collect variable terms**: the process of combining the like terms of a variable in one side, this creates the variable side of the equation.

(Combinar términos constantes)
**Collect constant terms**: the process of combining like terms without variables, this creates the constant side of the equation.

(Ecuación lineal en dos variables)
**Linear equation in two variables**: linear equation with two variables, such that a change in one of the variables produces a proportional change in the other variable. For the standard form of a linear equation in two variables, let $A$, $B$, $C$, be constants, $x$, $y$, be variables, then $Ax + By = C$ is the standard form of the linear equation with variables $x$ and $y$. The amount of solutions of a linear equation is infinite, the line formed by the equation can be extended indefinitely.

(Pendiente de una ecuación lineal)
**Slope of a linear equation**: the slope of a line is a ratio that shows how many units in the $y$-axis change when a single unit in the $x$-axis changes. In a given line, the slope is measured as the value changed in the $y$-axis divided by the equivalent change in the $x$-axis.

The slope of an horizontal line is $0$ and the slope of a vertical line is undefined (positive or negative infinity). A negative slope means that whenever the value in the $x$-axis increases, the value in the $y$-axis decreases, and vice versa. A positive slope indicates that both values in $x$ and $y$ increase or decrease together.

(Fórmula de la pendiente)
**Slope formula**: the slope of a line that passes through two given points, is equal to the ratio of the difference of the $y$-axis values of the two points over the difference of the $x$-axis values of the two points. Let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be two points in the $x$-$y$ plane, and let $m$ be the slope that they form, then $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2}$.

The rise (elevación) of a slope is the amount changed in the $y$ axis, namely $y_2 - y_1$. The run (avance) of a slope is the amount changed in the $x$ axis, namely $x_2 - x_1$. So the algebraic definition of the slope can also be interpreted as rise over run.

(Elevación sobre avance de una pendiente)
**Rise over run of a slope**: in a slope, rise over run is the fraction of the vertical distance called "rise" over the horizontal distance called "run".

(Forma pendiente intercepto de una línea)
**Slope-intercept form of a line**: an equation that expresses the $y$ coordinate of each point of a line, as the the slope multiplied by the $x$ coordinate of that point, plus the $y$-intercept. Let $y$ be the $y$ coordinate of a given point, let $x$ be the $x$ coordinate of the same point, let $m$ be the slope, $b$ be the $y$-intercept, then $y = mx + b$.

(Pendiente de líneas paralelas)
**Slope of parallel lines**: the slope of a set of parallel lines is the same for all the lines, i.e. all parallel lines have the same slope. This is because for lines to be parallel, they must have the same rise and run. Using the slope-intercept form of a line, parallel lines have the same slope but different $y$-intercept values.

(Pendiente de líneas perpendiculares)
**Slope of perpendicular lines**: given the slope $m$ of a line, the slope of a perpendicular line to it, is $-1/m$. This is because given the slope of a line, the slope of a line perpendicular to it, is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of the given line.

(Fórmula de distancia)
**Distance formula**: the distance formula is the application of the Pythagorean theorem in the rectangular coordinate system. Let $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, be two points in the $x$-$y$ plane, and let $d$ be the distance between them, then $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

(Distancia más corta entre un punto y una recta)
**Shortest distance between a point and a line**: given a point and a line, the shortest distance possible between them, is the perpendicular distance between them, i.e. a perpendicular line to the given line that passes through the given point, is used to measure this shortest distance, as the distance between the given point and the intersection of the perpendicular line and the given line.

(Distancia más corta entre dos líneas paralelas)
**Shortest distance between two parallel lines**: given two parallel lines, the shortest distance possible between them, is the perpendicular distance between them, i.e. a perpendicular line that passes through both parallel lines, is used to measure this shortest distance, as the distance between the two intersections of the perpendicular line with the two parallel lines. By definition of parallel lines, the shortest distance between them is a constant.

### Polynomials (Polinomios)

A polynomial is an expression of one or more terms added together. The terms may contain variables. If the only variable in a polynomial is $x$, the polynomial can be denoted as $p(x)$ or using other letters, as $q(x)$. For example $p(x) = x^2 + 5x^3 - 4x - 7$.

(Monomio)
**Monomial**: a polynomial with only one term.

(Binomio)
**Binomial**: a polynomial with two terms.

(Trinomio)
**Trinomial**: a polynomial with three terms.

(Grado de un polinomio)
**Degree of a polynomial**: the degree of the term $ax^n$ is the exponent $n$. In a polynomial with several terms, the degree is the maximum of the exponents. For example, in $p(x) = x^2 + 5x^3 - 4x - 7$, the degree of $p(x)$ is $3$ because that's the maximum exponent in the terms.

(Forma estándar de un polinomio)
**Standard form of a polynomial**: a polynomial with its terms written in descending order of the exponents of one given variable. For example, the standard form of $p(x) = x^2 + 5x^3 - 4x - 7$ is $p(x) = 5x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 7$.

(Evaluación de polinomios)
**Polynomial evaluation**: polynomial evaluation is done like regular evaluation of expressions. For example, in $p(x) = 5x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 7$ evaluating $p(x)$ in $2$ gives $p(2) = 5(2)^3 + (2)^2 - 4(2) - 7 = 40 + 4 - 8 - 7 = 44 - 15 = 29$, so evaluating $p(x)$ in $2$ gives $29$.

#### Operations with polynomials (Operaciones con polinomios)

(Adición de polinomios)
**Addition of polynomials**: the operation of addition made with polynomials. Addition of polynomials is based on combining like terms, i.e. only the terms with the same variables and exponents are added together. For example, given $p(x) = 2x^3 + 4x - 7$ and $q(x) = 3x - 2$, then $p(x) + q(x) = 2x^3 + 7x - 9$.

(Sustracción de polinomios)
**Subtraction of polynomials**: the operation of subtraction made with polynomials. Subtraction of polynomials is bases on combining like terms, i.e. only the terms with the same variables and exponents can be subtracted from one another. For example, given $p(x) = 2x^3 + 4x - 7$ and $q(x) = 3x - 2$, then $p(x) - q(x) = 2x^3 + x - 5$.

(Multiplicación de monomios)
**Monomial multiplication**: let $a$, $b$, $k$, $l$, $m$, $n$, be numbers and $x$, $y$ be variables, then the product of the monomials $ax^ky^l$ and $bx^my^n$ is $abx^{k + m}y^{l + n}$.

(Multiplicación de polinomios)
**Multiplication of polynomials**: the multiplication of polynomials is based on the distributive property of multiplication over addition (and subtraction). In the product of two polynomials, each term of the first polynomial is multiplied by the second polynomial using the distributive property.

For example, given $p(x) = 2x^3 + 4x - 7$ and $q(x) = 3x - 2$, then $p(x)q(x) = (2x^3)(3x) + (2x^3)(-2) + (4x)(3x) + (4x)(-2) + (-7)(3x) + (-7)(-2) = 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 8x - 21x + 14 = 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 29x + 14$, so $p(x)q(x) = 6x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 29x + 14$.

(División de monomios)
**Monomial division**: let $a$, $b$, $k$, $l$, $m$, $n$, be numbers and $x$, $y$ be variables, then the division of the monomial $ax^ky^l$ over $bx^my^n$ is $\frac{a}{b}x^{k - m}y^{l - n}$.

(División de polinomios)
**Division of polynomials**: this operation is done according to the degrees of the polynomials in the dividend and divisor. In a fraction of polynomials, if the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, then that fraction can not be simplified further, i.e. it behaves as a proper fraction.

Long division of polynomials (División larga de polinomios) is a way to divide polynomials. With the polynomials in the fraction written in standard form, each individual term of the numerator from left to right is divided by the first term of the denominator, until the degree of the term being divided is less than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator.

In general, let $x$ be a variable, $p(x)$, $g(x)$ be the two polynomials being divided, let $q(x)$ be the quotient of the division, and $r(x)$ be the remainder, then $\frac{p(x)}{g(x)} = q(x) + \frac{r(x)}{g(x)}$.

For example, given $p(x) = 3x^2 + 7x + 4$ and $g(x) = x + 1$, then $\frac{p(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{3x^2 + 7x + 4}{x + 1}$. The first term in the quotient is $3x$ because $3x(x) = 3x^2$ which is the first term in the dividend. Multiplying $3x$ by the divisor and then subtracting the result from the dividend gives, $3x(x + 1) = 3x^2 + 3x$, $3x^2 + 7x + 4 - 3x^2 - 3x = 4x + 4$, now the current dividend is $4x + 4$. The second term in the quotient is $4$, because $4(x) = 4x$ which is the first term in the current dividend. Doing the same process as before gives, $4(x + 1) = 4x + 4$, $4x + 4 - 4x - 4 = 0$. A current dividend of $0$ means that the division is over, and this $0$ is the remainder of the division, and so $\frac{p(x)}{g(x)} = 4x + 4$.

(Factorización)
**Factoring**: the process of finding the factors of a product.

(Factorización de polinomios)
**Polynomial factoring**: factoring applied to a polynomial, treating the polynomial as the product. After doing polynomial factoring, a polynomial is represented as factors that are multiplying each other.

(Máximo factor común de dos expresiones)
**Greatest common factor of two expressions**: the largest expression that is a factor of the two given expressions. For example, given $3x^2 + 6x$ and $9x$, the greatest common factor is $3x$.

(Máximo factor común de un polinomio)
**Greatest common factor of a polynomial**: the largest expression that is a factor of all the terms in a given polynomial. For example, in $12x^2 + 24x$ the greatest common factor is $12x$.

## Geometry definitions (Definiciones de geometría)

Geometry (Geometría) means the study of figures and their spatial properties. Spatial refering to the space occupied by the figures, or their location with regards to one another.

(Postulado)
**Postulate**: the axioms of geometry, i.e. facts of geometry that are accepted as true. Postulates act as definitions.

(Figura)
**Figure**: a geometric object that occupies space.

(Diagrama)
**Diagram**: a picture or drawing used to show figures and their geometry.

(Forma de una figura)
**Shape of a figure**: the form of the figure.

(Tamaño de una figura)
**Size of a figure**: the amount of space occupied by the figure.

(Figuras similares | Figuras semejantes)
**Similar figures**: figures that have the same shape but not the same size. Similarity (semejanza) is denoted with the $\sim$ symbol. Let $Fig_1$ and $Fig_2$ represent two figures that are similar, this is written as $Fig_1 \sim Fig_2$. Similar figures have their corresponding angles congruent and their corresponding sides proportional.  This can be said as "corresponding sides of similar figures are proportional", and "corresponding angles of similar figures are congruent".

(Autosimilaridad)
**Self-similarity**: Self-similarity is a property of the figures in which a part of the figure has the same shape as the whole figure, which means that the part is similar to the whole, the figure is similar to itself.

(Fractales)
**Fractals**: figures that have infinite self-similarity, meaning that in a fractal, each part is similar to the whole, and then each part has subparts similar to the part, and each subpart has subsubparts similar to the subpart, and so on infinitely. Because of this, fractals can be created in iterations. The initial shape before the first iteration is called stage 0 (etapa 0), and then the result of each iteration is the respective stage.

(Factor de escala)
**Scale factor**: in two similar figures, the scale factor is the constant that allows getting one figure from the other. Multiplying each length of the first figure by the scale factor, results in the lengths of the second figure. Dividing each length of the second figure by the scale factor, results in the lengths of the first figure.

Let $Fig_1$ and $Fig_2$ be two similar figures, $Fig_1 \sim Fig_2$, let $A_1$ and $B_1$ be two points on $Fig_1$ that are correspondent to the points $A_2$ and $B_2$ on $Fig_2$, and let $k$ be the scale factor to obtain $Fig_2$ from $Fig_1$, then $A_2B_2 = k A_1B_1$.

(Figuras congruentes)
**Congruent figures**: figures that have the same shape and also the same size. Let $\overline{AB}$ be a segment, the congruence with itself is denoted as $\overline{AB} \cong \overline{BA}$. This symbol $\cong$ is used in general to indicate two congruent geometric figures.

(Figuras irregulares)
**Irregular figures**: irregular figures are figures whose shape is not a basic shape.

(Lados y ángulos correspondientes)
**Corresponding sides and angles**: in similar or congruent figures, the sides and angles that would be the same if replacing one figure for the other. The corresponding sides of two figures have the same ratio (which is $1$ for congruent figures), and their corresponding angles have the same value. Similar triangles are similar figures.

(Punto)
**Point**: a single piece of space that has no extension, i.e. a figure with zero dimensions. Points are used to indicate locations in space, they are represented with dots in diagrams. Points are commonly labeled using an uppercase letter, such as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.

(Línea | Recta)
**Line**: a shape with infinite points that extends in a single dimension indefinitely. A line has no start nor ending, it has a given direction and a location in space. Lines are labeled using a single lowercase letter, such as $g$, or with the labels of two points on the line and a bidirectional arrow on top, such as $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{QP}$. All these three labels denote the same line.

(Plano)
**Plane**: a shape with infinite lines that extends in two dimensions (2D) indefinitely. A plane has no start nor ending, it has a given direction and a location in space. Planes are labeled using a single uppercase letter in a calligraphic font, such as $\mathcal{M}$. A plane can also be named with the labels of any three points on the plane, such as the plane $ABC$, or $BCA$, or $CAB$ or any other combination.

(Espacio tridimensional)
**3D space**: space in which the basic geometric shapes exist. Shapes in zero, one, or two dimensions, can be seen in 3D space. This space has three dimensions, it extends indefinitely in width, length, and height.

(Puntos colineales)
**Collinear points**: points that are on the same line. All the points on a given line are collinear.

(Puntos coplanares)
**Coplanar points**: points that are on the same plane. All the points on a given plane are coplanar.

(Punto equidistante a otros puntos)
**Equidistant point to other points**: a given point is equidistant to other points when its distance to all the other points is the same.

(Líneas coplanares)
**Coplanar lines**: lines that are on the same plane. All the lines on a given plane are coplanar.

(Segmento de línea)
**Line segment**: a truncated line that ends in both of its sides and does not extend indefinitely. The points where the line ends are called endpoints (puntos extremos). Line segments are labeled using its endpoints and a horizontal bar on top of them, such as $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BA}$. They can also be simply called segments.

(Rayo)
**Ray**: a line that is only truncated in one side, while the other side extends indefinitely. A ray has one endpoint. Rays are labeled using the endpoint and the point inside the ray with an arrow on top, such as $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overleftarrow{BA}$. The arrow on top points in the same direction as the ray.

(Intersección)
**Intersection**: the point or points where two shapes cross each other. When two distinct lines intersect, the intersection is a point. When two distinct planes intersect, the intersection is a line. When a line outside of a plane intersects said plane, the intersection is a point. When three distinct planes intersect, the intersection is a point.

(Punto de concurrencia)
**Point of concurrency**: the intersection in a single point, of three or more lines, rays, or segments.

(Vértice)
**Vertex**: any point from which one or more lines stem.

(Ángulo)
**Angle**: in two lines (or segments, or rays) that share a vertex, the angle is the measure of rotation of one line to get to the other. If a vertex has only two lines, then an angle can be named after said vertex. Let $A$ be a vertex with two lines stemming from it, then $\angle A$ is the angle formed between the two lines, and $m \angle A$ is the measure of said angle. Angles are commonly shown in diagrams with an arc between the two lines.

If more than two lines stem from a vertex, then an unambiguous way to label an angle is using three points, the vertex and one point in each of the two lines in the angle. For example, given the vertex $A$, the point $B$ in one line, and the point $C$ in the other line, then the angle formed can be labeled as $\angle BAC$ or $\angle CAB$, putting the vertex $A$ in the middle.

Angles are commonly measured in degrees and in radians. In degrees a whole rotation that ends at the starting position is measured as $360 \text{\textdegree}$ read as $360$ degrees ($360$ grados), and in radians this is measured as $2 \pi$ read as $2 \pi$ radians ($2 \pi$ radianes). Given those measures, half a whole rotation is $180 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi$ radians.

An angle can be measured in two ways, because there are two ways in which a ray can be rotated to coincide with another (rotating the ray clockwise, and rotating the ray counterclockwise). The standard definition of the measure of an angle, is that it's the smallest measure of the two. The smallest measure of an angle is always less than or equal to half a circle, i.e. $180 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi$ radians. Still, angles greater than $\pi$ can be considered.

(Vértice de un ángulo)
**Vertex of an angle**: in an angle, the vertex is the endpoint where the two lines join. In the angle $\angle ABC$, the vertex is the point $B$.

(Lados de un ángulo)
**Sides of an angle**: each of the two lines that form the angle.

(Ángulo recto)
**Right angle**: the angle of a quarter of a circle, i.e. $90 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi/2$ radians. The arc between the rays that is used to denote a right angle is a small square instead of an arc.

(Líneas perpendiculares)
**Perpendicular lines**: two lines (or rays, or segments) that cross each other at right angles, i.e. the four angles formed at the intersection of the lines are right angles. Perpendicularity is denoted with the $\perp$ symbol, e.g. given two lines $l$ and $m$ that are perpendicular to each other, this is denoted as $l \perp m$, which is the same as $m \perp l$.

(Paralelismo en geometría)
**Geometric parallelism**: the relationship that is produced when two distinct figures extend indefinitely and never intersect each other. Two parallel lines that belong to the same plane, extend indefinitely and never intersect each other. Two parallel planes in space, extend indefinitely and never intersect each other. The distance between parallel lines or planes is constant. The symbol $\parallel$ indicates a parallel relation. Let $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$, $\overleftrightarrow{CD}$ be two lines, such that they are parallel to each other, this can be denoted as $\overleftrightarrow{AB} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{CD}$, read as the line $AB$ is parallel to the line $CD$ (la línea $AB$ es paralela a la línea $CD$). In diagrams, parallel lines are indicated by placing arrowheads inside the lines. Each set of parallel lines has its own amount of arrowheads.

(Propiedad transitiva de las líneas paralelas)
**Transitive property of parallel lines**: given two parallel lines, if the first one is parallel to a third line, then the second line is also parallel to the third, if $k \parallel l$ and $l \parallel m$, then $k \parallel m$.

(Líneas alabeadas)
**skew lines**: a relationship between two lines, such that they are not parallel but also do not intersect. This is possible in lines that belong to different planes.

(Línea transversal)
**Transversal line**: a line that intersects two other distinct lines.

(Partes de una transversal)
**Parts of a transversal**: a few named parts of transversals in general.

- **Interior area** (Área interna): the area between the two lines crossed by the transversal, e.g. the area between $l$ and $m$.

- **Exterior area** (Área externa): the area outside of the two lines crossed by the transversal, e.g. the area outside of $l$ and $m$.

- **Corresponding angles** (Ángulos correspondientes): two angles that are in the same position relative to the transversal, but each on a different line, e.g. $\angle 1$ and $\angle 5$ are corresponding angles, like $\angle 2$ and $\angle 6$, also $\angle 3$ and $\angle 7$, and lastly $\angle 4$ and $\angle 8$ form corresponding angle pairs.

- **Alternate interior angles** (Ángulos alternos internos): two angles that lie on the interior area, do not form a linear pair, and are on opposite sides of the transversal, e.g. $\angle 3$ and $\angle 6$ are alternate interior angles, like $\angle 4$ and $\angle 5$.

- **Alternate exterior angles** (Ángulos alternos externos): two angles that lie on the exterior area, do not form a linear pair, and are on opposite sides of the transversal, e.g. $\angle 1$ and $\angle 8$ are alternate exterior angles, like $\angle 2$ and $\angle 7$.

- **Same side interior angles** (Ángulos conjugados internos): two angles that lie on the interior area, are distinct, and are on the same side of the transversal, e.g. $\angle 3$ and $\angle 5$ are same side interior angles, like $\angle 4$ and $\angle 6$.

- **Same side exterior angles** (Ángulos conjugados externos): two angles that lie on the exterior area, are distinct, and are on the same side of the transversal, e.g. $\angle 1$ and $\angle 7$ are same side exterior angles, like $\angle 2$ and $\angle 8$.

- **Consecutive angles** (Ángulos consecutivos): same side angles are also known as consecutive angles.

(Proporcionalidad entre transversales)
**Transversal proportionality**: any set of parallel lines can be crossed by an infinite amount of transversals. The transversals are divided proportionally, so the segments formed by the intersections of each transversal with the parallels, are proportional to those of the other transversals. For example, given three parallels and two transversals, the first transversal with intersections $A$, $B$, and $C$, and the second transversal with intersections $D$, $E$, and $F$ respectively, then there are proportions between the corresponding segments created with the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and the points $D$, $E$, $F$, because of this, it can be said that the figure $ABC$ is similar to the figure $DEF$.

(Ángulo llano)
**Straight angle**: the angle of half a circle, i.e. $180 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi$ radians. Two rays that have this angle form a straight line.

(Rayos opuestos)
**Opposite rays**: two rays with a straight angle between them.

(Ángulo agudo)
**Acute angle**: an angle greater than or equal to $0 \text{\textdegree}$ ($0$ radians) and less than $90 \text{\textdegree}$ ($\pi/2$ radians).

(Ángulo obtuso)
**Obtuse angle**: an angle greater than $90 \text{\textdegree}$ ($\pi/2$ radians) and less than $180 \text{\textdegree}$ ($\pi$ radians).

(Ángulos suplementarios)
**Supplementary angles**: two angles that added together measure $180 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi$ radians. Each angle in this pair is the supplement (suplemento) of the other.

(Ángulos complementarios)
**Complementary angles**: two angles that added together measure $90 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi/2$ radians. Each angle in this pair is the complement (complemento) of the other.

(Vuelta completa)
**Full circle**: the angle measure of $2 \pi$ radians or $360 \text{\textdegree}$.

(Ángulos adyacentes)
**Adjacent angles**: two angles that have the same vertex and share one side, without overlapping each other, which means that only three rays are required to create two adjacent angles.

(Par lineal)
**Linear pair**: two adjacent angles such that the two non-shared sides form a straight line.

(Ángulos verticales)
**Vertical angles**: in the intersection of two lines, vertical angles are pairs of angles that are on opposite sides of the intersection.

(Ángulo comprendido entre dos lados)
**Included angle between two sides**: the angle between two given sides, is the included angle, so the sides must share a vertex, which is the vertex of the angle.

(Lado comprendido entre dos ángulos)
**Included side between two angles**: a side that is common to two differnt angles. The angles surround the side by placing themselves at each endpoint of the side.

(Bisectriz de un segmento)
**Segment bisector**: a line, ray, or segment, that passes through the midpoint of a given segment in any angle.

(Mediatriz)
**Perpendicular bisector**: a line, ray, or segment, that passes through the midpoint of a given segment in a perpendicular way.

(Bisectriz de un ángulo)
**Angle bisector**: a line, ray, or segment, that divides a given angle into two congruent angles, each with half the measure of the given angle. Given that the segment $\overline{AC}$ is the angle bisector of the angle $\angle DAB$, then $m \angle DAC = m \angle BAC$.

(Transformaciones geométricas)
**Geometric transformations**: procedures that take a figure and modify it in different ways. A transformed figure is commonly denoted by appending an apostrophe to its name, or the parts of its name. For example the figure $ABC$ can be transformed into the figure $A'B'C'$, read as figure $A$ prime $B$ prime $C$ prime (figura $A$ prima $B$ prima $C$ prima).

(Transformaciones rígidas)
**Rigid transformations**: geometric transformations over a figure, that do not change the size of the figure.

(Mapeo de un punto a otro)
**Mapping from a point to another**: mappings are a way to symbolize geometric transformations in the coordinate plane. Let the point $(x, y)$ be transformed into the point $(x', y')$, this can be denoted as $(x, y) \to (x', y')$, read as the point $(x, y)$ is mapped to $(x', y')$ (el punto $(x, y)$ es mapeado a $(x', y')$).

(Transformación de dilatación)
**Dilation transformation**: a non-rigid transformation that is used to increase or decrease the size of a figure, to 'dilate' it. The resulting figure of a dilation is similar to the original figure.

Dilations are defined with two parts, a center (centro) and an scale factor (factor de escala). The scale factor is defined the same as the definition already given (it's always greater than zero). The center is the point around which the dilation is performed, the point around which the scale factor is applied. This means that the farther away that the center of dilation is from the figure, the farther away that the resulting dilation is from the original.

(Dilatación de un punto)
**Point dilation**: the most basic dilation transformation. All dilations can be seen as point dilations applied to each point in a figure, and then connecting the dilated points with corresponding segments. Given a figure consisting of a single point $B$, and a center of dilation $A$, the dilation is a point $C$, such that $AC = k AB$.

(Dilataciones en el plano coordenado)
**Dilations in the coordinate plane**: a given 2D figure $Fig_1$ is composed of a set of points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane. Let $Fig_1$ be dilated with dilation center $C$ located at $(x_C, y_C)$, and scale factor $k$, into the dilation $Fig_1'$. The figure $Fig_1'$ is composed of a set of points $(x', y')$ in the coordinate plane, this can be denoted with the mapping $(x, y) \to (x', y')$. The point $(x', y')$ can be obtained from $C$ and $k$, as $(x', y') = (x_C + k (x - x_C), y_C + k (y - y_C))$. In the case where $C$ is the origin $(0, 0)$, the mapping becomes $(x', y') = (kx, ky)$.

(Ratios trigonométricos)
**Trigonometric ratios**: ratios specifically created with the lengths of the sides of right triangles. These ratios change by varying the non-right angles in the right triangle. Given that a right triangle only has three sides, there are only three basic ratios possible between pairs of the three sides.

**Adjacent side and opposite side to an angle in a right triangle**: every right triangle has two non-right angles. Each of these two non-right angles has an adjacent side and an opposite side. The opposite side is the regular opposite side of an angle in a triangle. The adjacent side is the side of the angle that is not the hypotenuse.

**Trigonometric ratios of any angle**: in a right triangle, the non-right angles are always acute, but the trigonometric ratios can still be measured in non-acute angles. For this, the angle is put in the rectangular coordinate system. Because of the definition of an angle, any point in the angle side always falls in one of the four quadrants of the rectangular coordinate system. A right angle is built in that quadrant, using as hypotenuse the segment from the origin to a point in the angle, and using as legs the $x$ and $y$ projections of the point on the rectangular coordinate system, and the trigonometric ratios of the angle are determined using that right triangle (this also works for acute angles).

(Teorema de la proporcionalidad en la bisectriz de un ángulo)
**Proportionality in an angle bisector theorem**: in a triangle, the angle bisector of any one of its angles creates a proportion. The angle bisector in a triangle, cuts the opposite side to the angle into two segments. The proportion created is that the first segment cut is to the second segment cut as the first side of the angle is to the second side of the angle bisected. In this definition, the first side can be any of the two sides of the angle, what matters is that the first segment cut is on the same side of the angle bisector as the first side of the angle, and the same for the second segment cut.

In a triangle $\triangle ABC$, the angle bisector of $\angle B$ intersects the side $\overline{AC}$ at a point $D$. This creates the proportion $\frac{AD}{CD} = \frac{AB}{BC}$.

(Fórmula del punto medio)
**Midpoint formula**: a formula to calculate the midpoint from two points, which can be the endpoints of a segment. Let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be two points in the $x$-$y$ plane, then the midpoint of the segment they form is $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$.

(Fórmula general para dividir un segmento en $n$ subsegmentos y calcular la localización del $k$-ésimo subsegmento)
**General formula to divide a segment into $n$ subsegments and get the location of the $k$-th subsegment**: let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be the two points that define a segment, this segment can be divided into $n$ subsegments.

Making $k = 1$ and $n = 2$ results in the midpoint formula.

(Triángulo)
**Triangle**: shape with three straight sides and therefore three angles. The three straight sides are three segments, in which each segment is connected to the other two with their endpoints. Triangles can be named using the three vertices that form at the intersections of their sides. Each vertex has an opposite side, i.e. the side that does not stem from the vertex. Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be three vertices that form a triangle, then the triangle is denoted as $\triangle ABC$ read as triangle ABC (triángulo ABC). Other form to denote the same triangle is $\triangle BCA$, or any other order of the points of the triangle. The length of the opposite side (lado opuesto) to each vertex is denoted with a lowercase letter, in this case $a$, $b$, and $c$. The sides can also be noted with the two vertices that form the side, in this case $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ respectively.

(Lado opuesto a un vértice en un triángulo)
**Opposite side of a vertex in a triangle**: in a triangle $\triangle ABC$, each vertex has an opposite side, the opposite side to $A$ is the side $\overline{BC}$, the opposite side to $B$ is $\overline{AC}$, and the opposite side to $C$ is $\overline{AB}$.

(Lado opuesto a un ángulo en un triángulo)

(Suma de los ángulos de un triángulo)
**Sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle**: the three measures of the angles of any triangle add up to $180 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi$ radians. Let $A$, $B$, $C$, be three vertices that form a triangle, then $m \angle A + m \angle B + m \angle C = \pi$.

(Triángulo rectángulo)
**Right triangle**: a triangle in which one of its angles measures $90 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi/2$ radians, i.e. a triangle with a right angle. The right angle is denoted in the triangle with a square.

Right triangles have three sides, one hypotenuse (hipotenusa) which is the side opposite to the right angle, and two legs (catetos) which are the two sides that stem from the vertex with the right angle.

(Triángulos rectángulos inscritos similares)
**Inscribed similar right triangles**: right triangles inscribed inside other right triangles that are similar.

(Media geométrica en triángulos rectángulos)
**Geometric mean in right triangles**: there are at least three geometric means in a right triangle, the two legs and the altitude from the right angle are all geometric means of different segments.

To understand this, consider the definition of geometric mean applied to only two numbers. Let $GM$ be the geometric mean of $x_1$ and $x_2$, so $GM = \sqrt{x_1 x_2}$. Representing this equation as a proportion, $GM^2 = x_1 x_2$, then $\frac{GM}{x_2} = \frac{x_1}{GM}$, and reordering $\frac{x_1}{GM} = \frac{GM}{x_2}$. This shows the numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ as the extremes of the proportion, and $GM$ as the means of the proportion.

Because of the inscribed similar right triangles theorem, in a right triangle $\triangle ABC$ with the right angle being $\angle A$, if the point $D$ is the point of the altitude from $\angle A$ that lies on $\overline{BC}$, then $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DAC \sim \triangle DBA$. The altitude of $\triangle ABC$ is $\overline{AD}$.

From $\triangle DAC \sim \triangle DBA$, $\frac{BD}{AD} = \frac{AD}{CD}$, which shows that the altitude $\overline{AD}$ is the geometric mean of the segments divided by $D$ in $\overline{BC}$. From $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DBA$, $\frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{AB}{BC}$, which shows that the leg $\overline{AB}$ is the geometric mean of the hypotenuse and the side of the hypotenuse cut by $D$ that is in the same side as the leg $\overline{AB}$. From $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DAC$, $\frac{CD}{AC} = \frac{AC}{BC}$, which shows that the leg $\overline{AC}$ is the geometric mean of the hypotenuse and the side of the hypotenuse cut by $D$ that is in the same side as the leg $\overline{AC}$.

(Lados de un triángulo rectángulo dado un ángulo y un lado)
**Sides of a right triangle given an angle and a side**: In a right triangle, having only one of the non-right angles and the length of any one side, is enough to determine the lengths of the other two sides, via the trigonometric ratios. In a right triangle $\triangle ABC$ with the right angle being $\angle A$, making $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$, the sides of the right triangle can be found in the following manners.

Having $a$ and $m \angle B$, $b = a\ sin(\angle B)$ and $c = a\ cos(\angle B)$. Having $a$ and $m \angle C$, $b = a\ cos(\angle C)$ and $c = a\ sin(\angle C)$. Having $b$ and $m \angle B$, $a = \frac{b}{sin(\angle B)}$ and $c = \frac{b}{tan(\angle B)}$. Having $b$ and $m \angle C$, $a = \frac{b}{cos(\angle C)}$ and $c = b\ tan(\angle C)$. Having $c$ and $m \angle B$, $a = \frac{c}{cos(\angle B)}$ and $b = c\ tan(\angle B)$. Having $c$ and $m \angle C$, $a = \frac{c}{sin(\angle C)}$ and $b = \frac{c}{tan(\angle C)}$.

(Ley de senos en triángulos obtusos)
**Law of sines in obtuse triangles**: the law of sines can be used to calculate the measure of obtuse angles. Because of the definitions of the trigonometric ratios, the trigonometric ratios of an obtuse angle are calculated using its supplement instead, which is an acute angle that allows building a right triangle. So when using the law of sines to determine an obtuse angle, the result should be corrected by calculating the supplement of the result, this yields the measure of the obtuse angle. In a triangle $\triangle ABC$ where the obtuse angle is $\angle A$, calculating $m \angle A$ with the law of sines results in $m \angle A_{supp}$, this is corrected as $m \angle A = \pi - m \angle A_{supp}$.

(Triángulos congruentes)
**Congruent triangles**: given two triangles, they are congruent if their corresponding sides are congruent and their corresponding angles are congruent. The congruence $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$, is true when $\overline{AB} \cong \overline{DE}$, $\overline{AC} \cong \overline{DF}$, $\overline{BC} \cong \overline{EF}$, $\angle A \cong \angle D$, $\angle B \cong \angle E$, and $\angle C \cong \angle F$. This can be expressed as "corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent". In the statement $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$ the order of the vertices follows the congruence.

The configurations AAA and SSA do not necessarily lead to congruent triangles.

(Triángulo rectángulo isósceles)
**Isosceles right triangle**: a right triangle with congruent legs. Because of this definition, the three angles are always the same, $\pi/2$ for the right angle, and $\pi/4$ and $\pi/4$ for the base angles, so all isosceles right triangles are similar.

(Hipotenusa de un triángulo rectángulo isósceles)
**Hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle**: the length of the legs $l$ is the same for both legs. The length of the hypotenuse is $h = \sqrt{2} l$, because by the pythagorean theorem $h^2 = l^2 + l^2 = 2 l^2$, so $h = \sqrt{2 l^2} = \sqrt{2} l$.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, given $h$ as the length of the hypotenuse, $l_1$ as the length opposite to the 30 degrees angle, and $l_2$ as the length opposite to the 60 degress angle, then $l_1 = \frac{h}{2}$, and $l_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} h$.

Every triangle has three midsegments.

(Circuncentro de un triángulo)
**Circumcenter of a triangle**: in a triangle, the circumcenter is the point of concurrency formed at the intersection of the three perpendicular bisectors, one from each side. The circumcenter is in the three perpendicular bisectors of a triangle, and due to the perpendicular bisector theorem, the circumcenter is equidistant to the three vertices of the triangle. This allows building a circle that circumscribes (circunscribe) the triangle, using the circumcenter as center of said circle, and the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex as the radius.

(Incentro de un triángulo)
**Incenter of a triangle**: in a triangle, the incenter is the point of concurrency formed at the intersection of the three angle bisectors, one from each vertex. The incenter is in the three angle bisectors of a triangle, and due to the equidistance in an angle bisector theorem, the incenter is equidistant to the three sides of the triangle. This allows building a circle that inscribes (inscribe) the triangle, using the incenter as center of said circle, and the shortest distance from the incenter to any side as the radius.

Given that each vertex in a polygon has two sides, two exterior angles can be drawn from each vertex, both being congruent to each other due to the vertical angles theorem. In a given vertex of a polygon, the interior angle and one exterior angle (any of the two) form a linear pair, which means they are supplementary.

In a circle $\bigodot A$, given two radii $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, that make an angle $\angle BAC$ with a measure less than $\pi$, then the arc $\widehat{BC}$ is a minor arc. For the corresponding major arc, an extra point is needed to differentiate it from the minor arc. Let a point $D$ lie on the major arc, this arc is then labeled as $\widehat{BDC}$. The central angle refers to the angle spanned by the minor arc.

(Triángulo de Sierpinski)
**Sierpinski triangle**: a triangle fractal with infinite upside down triangles inside. The stage 0 shape is a triangle (commonly an equilateral triangle, but it doesn't have to be).

Every triangle has a smaller similar triangle that is formed with its midsegments, with a scale factor of $1/2$ because of the midsegment of a triangle theorem. The smaller similar triangle is always upside down, relative to the original triangle. The Sierpinski triangle is created by 'cutting out', or coloring the smaller similar upside down triangle formed with the midsegments. For this work, lets call the 'smaller similar upside down triangle formed with the midsegments' simply as the 'upside down triangle' because that's the most important visual feature for the Sierpinski triangle.

To create this fractal, the first iteration colors the only one upside down triangle, in the result there are now three non-colored triangles, one in each side of the colored triangle. The second iteration colors the three upside down triangles inside the three non-colored triangles from iteration 1, this leaves now 9 non-colored triangles. The next iteration colors all the upside down triangles inside all the non-colored triangles from the former iteration, and so on.

(Cantidad de triángulos por etapa en un triángulo de Sierpinski)
**Amount of triangles per stage in a Sierpinski triangle**: the amounts of non-colored triangles and of colored triangles in a Sierpinski triangle, follow certain patterns.

The amount of non-colored triangles of stage $n$ is $NCT_n = 3^n$ where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$, because in stage 0 there is only $1 = 3^0$ non-colored triangle. In stage 1, the colored triangle divides the initial triangle into $3 = 3^1$ non-triangles. The logic here is that each colored triangle will divide its container non-colored triangle into three non-colored triangles. So in stage 2, the $3$ non-colored triangles are divided into $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ non-colored triangles. In stage 3, the $9$ non-colored triangles are divided into $9 \cdot 3 = 27$ non-colored triangles, and so on.

The amount of colored triangles of stage $n$ is $CT_n = CT_{n - 1} + NCT_{n - 1}$, with $CT_0 = 0$, because in stage 0 there are $0$ colored triangles, in stage 1 there is $1$ colored triangle which comes from the $1$ non-colored triangle from stage 0. In stage 2 there are $4$ colored triangles, $1$ colored triangle from stage 1 and $3$ new ones from stage 1, and so on.

(Copo de nieve de Koch)
**Koch snowflake**: a triangle fractal with infinite similar triangles, one coming out of the center third of each side. The stage 0 shape is a triangle (commonly an equilateral triangle, but it doesn't have to be).

To create this fractal, the first iteration divides each side of the original triangle into three thirds, a triangle similar to the original is drawn in the center third, such that the sides of the new triangle are placed parallel to the original triangle. The second iteration divides each side that resulted from iteration 1 into three thirds and the process is repeated (draw a similar triangle in the center third with its sides parallel to the original), and so on. This procedure causes that the new triangles from an iteration are upside down from the triangles in the former iteration, because of the need to maintain corresponding sides parallel.

(Lados y longitud por lado en un copo de nieve de Koch)
**Sides and length per side in a Koch snowflake**: the amount of sides and the length per side in a Koch snowflake, both follow certain patterns.

The amount of sides $s_n$ of stage $n$ is $s_n = 3 \cdot 4^n$, because in stage 0 there are only the $3 = 3 \cdot 4^0$ sides of the initial triangle. In stage 1, each one of the $3$ sides of the triangle gives origin to $4$ new sides, for a total of $12 = 3 \cdot 4^1$ sides in total for stage 1, because each side of stage 0 is divided in three parts but the center third is divided into two sides of the smaller new triangle, resulting in $4$ new sides, and so on for the rest of stages (each side creates $4$ new sides).

The length per side is $1/3$ of the side that it stems from. If a Koch snowflake is created from an scalene triangle, then each there are three lengths, one for each side of the initial triangle. The length per side $l_{i, n}$ parallel to the side $i$ of the initial triangle in stage $n$, is $l_{i, n} = \frac{L_i}{3^n}$, where $L_i$ is the length of the side $i$ of the initial triangle. This is because stage $n$ divides each side in thirds (which explains the denominator $3^n$), and the original length from which each side is divided is $L_i$.

(Conjunto de Cantor)
**Cantor set**: a segment fractal with infinite smaller subsegments, each originated by dividing a previous segment into three thirds and removing the center third. The stage 0 shape is a segment.

To create this fractal, the first iteration divides the initial segment into three thirds and removes the center third. The second iteration takes the two subsegments that resulted from the first iteration, and divides them into three thirds and removes the center third, and so on.

(Cantidad de subsegmentos y longitud por subsegmento en un conjunto de Cantor)
**Amount of subsegments and length per subsegment in a Cantor set**: the amount of subsegments and the length per subsegment in a Cantor set, both follow certain patterns.

The amount of subsegments $s_n$ of stage $n$ is $s_n = 2^n$, because dividing a segment into three thirds and then removing the center third leaves only two subsegments each time, and given that all subsegments undergo this process in each iteration, the result is that the amount of subsegments is double the amount of subsegments in the previous iteration.

The length per subsegment $l_n$ of stage $n$ is $l_n = \frac{L}{3^n}$, where $L$ is the length of the initial segment. This is because the initial segment is divided into thirds each iteration.

## Probability definitions (Definiciones de probabilidad)

(Frecuencia de un número en un conjunto)
**Frequency of a number in a set**: the amount of times a given number is repeated in a set.

(Probabilidad de un evento)
**Probability of an event**: the fraction of the number of times an event happens over the number of general outcomes with or without the event.

For example, in a set of $N$ numbers, the probability $P(x)$ to obtain a given number $x$ that has a frequency of $f_x$ is $P(x) = \frac{f_x}{N}$.

### Measures of central tendency (Medidas de tendencia central)

(Promedios)
**Averages**: measures of the typical number in a set of numbers. A typical number is that which is most likely to appear from the set, or one that has a value in the middle of the values of the set. The measure of an average itself doesn't have to be part of the set of numbers, so a number that is not in the set, could be a representative value for said set.

(La media)
**The mean**: also called the arithmetic average (la media aritmética), it's the sum of a set of numbers divided by the size of the set. Let $X$ be a set of $N$ numbers, $x_i$ be the $i$-th number in the set, $\bar{x}$ be the mean of the set, then $\bar{x} = \sum_i{\frac{x_i}{N}}$. The mean is the number $\bar{x}$ whose repeated addition with itself $N$ times results in the same value as the sum of the original values $\sum_i{x_i}$, so if the mean $\bar{x}$ replaced each number $x_i$, then the total sum would be the same.

(Mediana)
**Median**: the middle value in a set of numbers, such that half the numbers are greater than the median, and the other half is less than the median. After sorting the set, when the set contains an odd amount of numbers, the median is the value in the middle, and when the set has an even amount of numbers, the median is the mean of the two values in the middle.

(Moda)
**Mode**: the number with the highest frequency in a set. A set of numbers can have several modes if several numbers have the same highest frequency, or none if all the numbers have the same frequency.

(Media geométrica)
**Geometric mean**: a measure of central tendency of $n$ numbers, that consists in taking the $n$-th root of the product of the $n$ numbers. Let there be $n$ numbers, where $x_i$ is the $i$-number. Let $GM(x)$ be the geometric mean of the $n$ numbers, then $GM(x) = \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 ... x_n}$. The geometric mean $GM(x)$ is the number whose repeated multiplication is the same as the product $x_1 x_2 ... x_n$, so if the geometric mean replaced each number $x_i$, then the total product would be the same.

## Simplifications (Simplificaciones)

(Reducir fracciones)
**Reduce fractions**: form of simplification in which a fraction is expressed as an equivalent fraction that has no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. If there is a common factor, both the numerator and the denominator are divided by it, this simplifies the fraction.

For example $\frac{6}{9} = \frac{4}{6}$, but their reduced form is $\frac{2}{3}$. In $\frac{6}{9}$ a common factor is $3$ and dividing the numerator and denominator by $3$ results in $\frac{2}{3}$. In $\frac{4}{6}$ a common factor is $2$ and dividing the numerator and denominator by $2$ results in $\frac{2}{3}$.

The same simplification can be done with variables, e.g. $\frac{2 x}{x}$ can be simplified to $\frac{2}{1}$ or $2$.

(Fracción irreducible)
**Simplified fraction**: a fraction in which the numerator and the denominator have no common factors.

(Eliminar los denominadores de una ecuación)
**Clear an equation of fractions**: the process of clearing the fractions of an equation, by multiplying each term on both sides by the least common denominator.

(Racionalizar el denominador)
**Rationalize the denominator**: when a fraction has a radical in the denominator, it can be rationalized to remove the radical from the denominator without changing the value of the fraction. The process is $\frac{a}{\sqrt{b}} = \frac{a \sqrt{b}}{\sqrt{b} \sqrt{b}} = \frac{a \sqrt{b}}{b}$.

(Conversión entre decimales y fracciones)
**Conversion between decimals and fractions**: decimals can be presented in fraction form, and vice versa. The conversion from fraction to decimal is done by performing the division of the numerator over the denominator of the fraction. The conversion from finite decimal to fraction is done by multiplying the decimal by 10 to the positive power of the place of the rightmost digit, and dividing the result over the same power of 10.

(Conversión de decimal periódico a fracción)
**Conversion from repeating decimal to fraction**: The conversion from repeating decimal to fraction is done by creating two numbers, each of which is the product of the decimal by a different power of 10, and then subtracting both numbers and dividing that difference by the subtraction of said powers of 10 (See Programs/Ch05/S03_01_Repeating_decimals.py).

Repeating decimals have a few parts, for example, in the number $894.57448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, the unique part (parte única) is $894.57$, and the repeating part (parte periódica) is $448132653$. In itself, the unique part has two parts (as any decimal number), the decimal part and the integer part.

For the unique part $894.57$, the original number is multiplied by 10 to the positive power of the place of the rightmost digit of the unique part, in this case $10^2$. For the repeating part, the original number is multiplied by 10 to the power of the sum of the amount of repeating digits and the power of 10 used for the unique part (in this case $2$). The amount of digits in $448132653$ is $9$, so for the repeating part, the original number is multiplied by $10^{9 + 2} = 10^{11}$.

Now to subtract these two products, let $a = 894.57448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, so $a 10^2 = 89457.448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, and $a 10^{11} = 89457448132653.448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, therefore $a 10^{11} - a 10^2 = 89457448043196$, as can be seen, this subtraction results in an integer. Continuing, $a 10^{11} - a 10^2 = a (10^{11} - 10^2)$, so $a = \frac{89457448043196}{(10^{11} - 10^2)} = \frac{89457448043196}{99999999900}$.

(Conversión entre porcentajes y decimales, y entre porcentajes y fracciones)
**Conversion between percents and decimals, and between percents and fractions**: the conversion from percent to fraction and decimal uses the definition of percent. Given that a percent is a ratio with denominator 100, the fraction is the percent number over 100, and the decimal is the result of the division of said fraction. For example, $54\%$ as a fraction is $\frac{54}{100}$, and as a decimal is $0.54$.

The conversion from decimal or fraction to percent is based on equivalent fractions. The decimal is converted to a fraction, and the fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100. For example the decimal $0.6$ as a fraction is $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$, and then as an equivalent fraction $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \cdot 20}{5 \cdot 20} = \frac{60}{100} = 60\%$.

A decimal can be converted directly to a percent, by multiplying it for $100$, e.g. $0.6 = 0.6 \cdot 100 \% = 60\%$. The opposite consists in dividing a percent by $100$ to obtain its decimal form.

When handling improper fractions, the resulting percent is greater than $100\%$, for example $\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 = 1.25 \cdot 100\% = 125\%$.

## Science and engineering definitions (Definiciones de ciencia e ingeniería)

(Ratio)
**Ratio**: a fraction of any two numbers that are measured with the same unit or scale, therefore ratios have no units themselves. For example the ratio of height to width, both are measured in distance.

The notation of ratios in particular, includes the use of the colon : symbol to replace the division symbol. So the ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ can be denoted as $a:b$. If $b = 1$ then the ratio is still presented as $\frac{a}{1}$, and if the ratio is an improper fraction, it is not converted to a mixed number. The ratio $a:b$ is read as $a$ to $b$ ($a$ a $b$).

In a ratio, the division operation is not actually made, for example the ratio $a:b$, in this ratio, if $a$ and $b$ are measured in type1 units, the ratio indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units of type1. The division is not performed. This allows writing ratios with more than two numbers, for example the ratio $a:b:c$ with $c$ also measured in type1 units, indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units, and also there are $a$ units per every $c$ units, and there are $b$ units per every $c$ units. When a ratio has more than two numbers, the fraction notation is not used, only the colon notation.

(Tasa)
**Rate**: a fraction of any two numbers that are measured in differente units or scales, so the unit of a rate is the fraction of the units. For example the rate of speed which is measured as a fraction of distance over time.

Ratios can be considered rates when the particular units in the numerator and denominator are also considered, even though they are the same. For example, width over height can be seen as a ratio, but also as the rate of width per unit of height, this rate is still dimensionless like a ratio.

(Tasa unitaria)
**Unit rate**: a rate expressed with a denominator of $1$.

(Precio unitario)
**Unit price**: a unit rate in which the unit is $\text{\textdollar}/unit$, it tells the price per unit.

(Porcentaje de aumento, porcentaje de disminución)
**Percent increase, percent decrease**: in general, the percent change (porcentaje de cambio) from a variable is measured as the difference of final value minus initial value, divided over the initial value, this result tells the amount of units changed per group of $1$ unit before change, and this can be converted to a percent.

Let $V_i$ be the initial value of a given variable, $V_f$ be the final value of said variable, $\Delta p\%$ be the percent change, then $\Delta p\% = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} 100\%$. Note that the words "initial" and "final" do not have to mean that they are separated in time, they can be separated under any criteria wanted.

Given that $V_f$ can be smaller or bigger than $V_i$, $\Delta p\%$ can be negative or positive, if it's negative then that means that the percent change is a percent decrease, whereas if it's positive then that means that the percent change is a percent increase.

(Notación científica)
**Scientific notation**: scientific notation is a way to express numbers. A given number written in scientific notation is represented as a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, multiplied by a power of 10.

Any number $N$ can be expressed in scientific notation, for this let $a$ be a number such that $a \ge 1$ and $a < 10$, and let $n$ be an integer, then $N = a 10^n$. To convert the given number $N$ to scientific notation, only its first nonzero digit is left as the first digit of $a$, and the remaining digits become decimals of $a$, this conversion is compensated as necessary using $n$, so that the equality $N = a 10^n$ is maintained. If $|N| \ge 1$ then $n$ must be zero or positive, while if $|N| < 1$ then $n$ must be negative.

For example, the number $-3894.15509$ expressed in scientific notation is $-3.89415509 \cdot 10^3$, given that the decimal point was moved to the left (higher place values) the value of $n$ is positive $3$.

(Sistemas de medida)
**Systems of measurement**: The systems of measurement are systems intended to be internally consistent, to provide a unit of measure for any physical quantity. The main quantities measured in these systems are time and space (time, distance, area, volume), derived quantities are also included like speed (distance divided by time), and also units of measure for other quantities, like electric field, radiation levels, etcetera.

There are two main systems of measurement used at the time of this writing, the U.S. system and the international metric system.

(Conversión de unidades)
**Unit conversion**: changing the units of a measure. Unit conversion is based on multiplying the unit to be changed by $1$, but writing $1$ in such a way that it changes the unit of measure. In general, given the units of measure $unit1$ and $unit2$, and given $A\ unit1 = B\ unit2$ meaning that $A$ units of $unit1$ are equal in measure to $B$ units of $unit2$, so $1 = \frac{B\ unit2}{A\ unit1}$, and also $1 = \frac{A\ unit1}{B\ unit2}$. These fractions are called conversion factors (factores de conversión).

Using real units, $1\ foot = 12\ inches$, so $1 = \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches}$, and $1 = \frac{12\ inches}{1\ foot}$. The fraction chosen to do the unit conversion is the one that divides the unit being changed, so, the one that has the unit being changed in the denominator. For example, to convert $60\ inches$ to $feet$, the conversion factor must have $inches$ in the denominator, $60\ inches \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} = 5 feet$.

Several conversions can be made one after the other, for example, $60\ inches \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} \frac{1\ yard}{3\ feet} = \frac{5}{3}\ yard$.

(Unidades de medida mixtas)
**Mixed units of measurement**: units of measure that are combined together to measure a single quantity. For example, using hours and minutes together to measure time.

When handling mixed units of measurement, each separate unit is added or subtracted separately. In the case of using hours and minutes together, for example $3\ hours, 12\ minutes$ plus $2\ hours, 20\ minutes$ is $5\ hours, 32\ minutes$, because hours and minutes are added separately. In this particular case, any amount of minutes over 60 is converted to hours accordingly, and in general the smaller unit is converted to the bigger unit if needed.

(Combinar unidades mixtas)
**Combine mixed units**: Mixed units of measure can be combined together into a single unit. For example, time measured in minutes and seconds can be combined into minutes alone, by adding the seconds divided by $60$ to the minutes.

Money measured in different currency valued coins and bills can be combined together into a single currency value (a standard value), by converting the total of each type of coin and bill to said currency value and then adding them.

Let $I$ be the set of unique units to be mixed, $i$ be a subindex of $I$, $v_i$ be the standard value per unit $i$, $a_i$ be the amount of unit $i$, $V_i$ be the subtotal standard value of unit $i$, and let $V$ be the total standard value, then $V_i = a_i v_i$ and $V = \sum_i{V_i}$.

The discount rate $d$ is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit of the price that becomes discounted.

(Margen de ganancia)
**Mark-up**: retailers buy goods at a wholesale price (precio mayorista), and then resell said goods at a list price (precio de lista | precio sugerido).

Let $W$ be the wholesale price of a good in monetary units, $M$ be the amount of mark-up in monetary units, $L$ be the list price in monetary units, and $m$ be the mark-up rate as a ratio, then $M = m W$ and $L = W + M = W + m W$. The mark-up rate is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit of the wholesale price that becomes mark-up.

(Fórmula del interés simple)
**Simple interest formula**: formula to calculate the simple interest from the loan principal, the interest rate, and the time elapsed since the loan started. Let $P$ be the principal of the investment or loan in monetary units, $I$ be the amount of interest in monetary units, $t$ be the time elapsed since the moment of the investment or loan in time units, and $r$ be the interest rate (tasa de interés) paid per period as a ratio, then $I = Prt$.
