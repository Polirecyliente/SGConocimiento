## Math definitions (Definiciones de matemática)

(Variables)
**Variables**: the representation of quantities that can vary, written using letters of the alphabet, such as $a, b, c, x, y, z$.

(Constantes)
**Constants**: the representation of quantities that can not vary, that stay always with the same value, written using letters of the alphabet, such as $m, n$.

The use of a letter of the alphabet as a variable or as a constant is determined from the context, so the context must state which letters are variables and which are constants.

(Funciones)
**Functions**: an operation or set of operations done over a number or numbers, that returns a result. Operators (Operadores) act as functions, e.g. $a + b$ can be written as $sum(a,b)$, where the function $sum$ returns the sum of $a$, $b$.

(Símbolos algebraicos)
**Algebraic symbols**: numbers, variables, constants, operators, functions.

(Enunciado matemático)
**Math statement**: any math writing that can be read as a statement, with symbols, signs, numbers, operators, etcetera, e.g. math expressions, equations, inequalities, and other.

(Expresión matemática)
**Math expression**: a math statement of numbers, symbols, and operations together, such as $a (b + c) - d$

(Simplificación)
**Simplification**: do all possible operations in an expression. $4 \cdot 2 + 1$ can be simplified to $9$. Symbols of rational numbers are left as is, for example $\sqrt{\pi}$ should not be simplified further.

(Evaluar una expresión)
**Evaluate an expression**: this means substitute symbols for specific values and calculate the result, e.g. in $x + 7$ substitute $x$ for $4$ and calculate, $4 + 7 = 11$. Expressions without symbols are ready to be evaluated.

## Points (Puntos)

(Origen)
**Origin**: this is the point at 0 in all dimensions, e.g. in three dimensions, the origin is $(0, 0, 0)$.

(Coordenada de un punto)
**Coordinate of a point**: an ordered tuple of numbers indicating the location of the point. In the three dimensional tuple $(a, b, c)$, $a$ indicates the location of the point along the first dimension, $b$ indicates the location of the point along the second dimension, and $c$ indicates the location of the point along the third dimension. This pattern continues if the tuple has more numbers.

## Numeral systems (Sistemas de numeración)

(Dígitos | Cifras)
**Digits**: each of the numeric values that makes up a number, e.g. the number $834$ has three digits, namely $8$, $3$, and $4$.

(Sistema de numeración posicional)
**Place value system**: system in which the value of a digit depends on its place in the number.

(Sistema de numeración decimal)
**Decimal place value system**: the most common place value system, each place is a power of 10, from right to left, starting at 0 in the first place, 1 in the second place and so on, e.g. $345$ is $3$ in the third position ($3$ of 10 to the power of 2), $4$ is in the second position ($4$ of 10 to the power of 1), and $5$ is in the first position ($5$ of 10 to the power of 0).

(Forma expandida de los números)
**Expanded form of the numbers**: numbers in a place value system can be shown in an expanded form, this expanded form is the sum of each of the digits in a given number multiplied by the base of the place value system to the power of its respective position, e.g. $345$ in expanded form is $3 \cdot 10^2 + 4 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0$

(Grupos en la numeración posicional)
**Plave value periods**: these periods are the separation of digits in groups of three, each has a name, ones, thousands, millions, thousandths, millionths, etcetera.

## Counting numbers (Números naturales)

(Números naturales)
**Counting numbers**: these are, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., up to infinity

## Whole numbers (Números naturales y el cero)

(Números naturales y el cero)
**Whole numbers**: these are, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., so the set of whole numbers is the same as the set of counting numbers and zero.

## Integer numbers (Números enteros)

The set of integers is the set of the whole numbers and the negative numbers. This set of numbers also forms an ordered set in which the relational operators can be used to compare the values of two integer numbers.

(Números positivos y negativos)
**Positive and negative numbers**: positive numbers are greater than 0 and negative numbers are less than 0, so 0 is neither. Negative numbers are represented with a minus in front, e.g. $-5$ is negative $5$. Positive numbers are greater than negative numbers.

(Números opuestos)
**Opposite numbers**: pairs of numbers only differentiated by their sign, one is positive and the other one is negative, but their value is the same. Opposite numbers are obtained with the minus sign.

The opposite of $a$ is $-a$, so $-(a) = -a$. The opposite of $-a$ is $a$, so $-(-a) = a$.

## Rational numbers (Números racionales)

The rational numbers form the set of numbers that can be represented via fractions. This is an ordered set in which the relational operators can be used to compare the values of two rational numbers.

Rational numbers when represented as decimals, have their decimal part with a finite amount of digits, or if the amount is infinite then it repeats itself, which means that a decimal number that is rational can always be represented as a fraction.

(Fracciones)
**Fractions**: numbers that represent a part of a whole number or an integer, so there are many fractions between any two integers.

(Notación de las fracciones)
**Fraction notation**: given that fractions are numbers that can be between two integers, they are represented with a division, a fraction that is not integer has a remainder different from 0 when represented as a division. Given two integers $a$ and $b$, with $b$ being nonzero, the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is calculated as $a$ divided by $b$.

For example, $\frac{2}{3}$ means $2$ divided by $3$, and using the definition of division, this calculates the amount of times that the number $3$ is subtracted from $2$ until 0 is reached, but subtracting $3$ from $2$ gives $-1$ because $2 - 3 = -1$, so to reach 0, a proportion, fraction, or part of $3$ must be subtracted from $2$, and not the full unity of the number $3$. 

By the definition of division, $\frac{2}{3}$ is the amount of times that $3$ is subtracted from $2$ to reach 0. This amount, $\frac{2}{3}$ is between $0$ and $1$ and it occupies the same proportional distance to $1$, as the number $2$ occupies to $3$.

(Numerador y denominador)
**Numerator and denominator**: the numbers in a fraction, the numerator is the number on top (called dividend in the division operation), and the denominator is the number at the bottom (called divisor in the division operation). In $\frac{a}{b}$ $a$ is the numerator and $b$ is the denominator.

(Fracciones propias)
**Proper fractions**: a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ in which $a < b$. A proper fraction is always between 0 and 1.

(Fracciones impropias)
**Improper fractions**: a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ in which $a \ge b$. An improper fraction can be an integer (when $a$ is a multiple of $b$), and it is always greater than or equal to 1, which means that an improper fraction has an integer part and a proper fraction part, when said parts are added the result is the improper fraction.

(Números mixtos)
**Mixed numbers**: the representation of an improper fraction as an integer part and a proper fraction part. The improper fraction $\frac{ac + b}{c} = a + \frac{b}{c}$ is represented as a mixed number as $a\frac{b}{c}$, so the addition of the integer part and the proper fraction part of a mixed number result in an equivalent improper fraction.

The term $ac$ in the numerator of $\frac{ac + b}{c}$, is a multiple of $c$, and when dividing $ac$ by $c$ the result is an integer $a$. In the mixed number $a\frac{b}{c}$, $a$ is the integer part, and $\frac{b}{c}$ is the proper fraction part.

(Fracciones equivalentes)
**Equivalent fractions**: fractions that have the same value, even when written with different numbers. Fractions written with different numbers can have the same value because those different numbers can show the same fraction. For example, the fraction $\frac{2}{3}$ is the same as the fraction $\frac{4}{6}$, because the proportional distance that the number $2$ occupies in $3$ is the same as the proportional distance that the number $4$ occupies in $6$. The value of each fraction itself is the same in equivalent fractions.

(Propiedad de las fracciones equivalentes)
**Equivalent fractions property**: in a given fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, multiplying (or dividing) both the numerator and the denominator by a non zero number $c$, doesn't change the value of the fraction, so $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot c}$.

(Fracciones complejas)
**Complex fractions**: the division of two fractions, $\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} = \frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \cdot d}{b \cdot c}$.

(Fracciones negativas)
**Negative fractions**: when either the numerator is negative, or the denominator is negative, the fraction itself is negative, $\frac{-a}{b} = -\frac{a}{b}$, and $\frac{a}{-b} = -\frac{a}{b}$.

(Decimales)
**Decimals**: the numeric representation of fractions in the place value system. Proper fractions have a value less than 1, to express them as decimals, the places to the right of the units place are used. The separation between the units place and the decimal places is commonly shown with a dot. For example, the numbers 0.1, 3.541, etc.

About their place value, the first place to the right of the dot has its value multiplied by 10 to the -1, the second place has its value multiplied by 10 to the -2, the third place to the -3, and so on.

(Decimales equivalentes)
**Equivalent decimals**: different decimal numbers that have the same value. For example $10.3$ has the same value as $10.30$, or $10.300$.

(Decimal finito)
**Finite decimal**: a decimal with a finite amount of digits after the decimal period.

(Decimal periódico)
**Repeating decimal**: a decimal in which a group of digits after the decimal period repeats itself indefinitely. Repeating decimals are denoted with a horizontal bar over the digits that repeat. For example, in $\frac{8}{7} = 1.\overline{142857}$, the line over $142857$ indicates that it repeats itself infinitely many times.

(Porcentaje)
**Percent**: ratio with a denominator of 100. A percent number is identified with the percent sign $\%$ after it. For example $54\%$ means the ratio $\frac{54}{100}$.

(Ecuación de porcentaje)
**Percentage equation**: an equation that defines a percent. To define a percent, two concepts are needed, the base (la base) and the amount (la cantidad). The base is the number that represents the whole, and the amount is the number that represents the part or fraction of that whole.

Let $p\%$ be a percent, $B$ be the base, $A$ be the amount, then $A = p\% \cdot B$. Isolating the percent allows finding its value from the amount and the base, $p\% = \frac{A}{B}$.

The reciprocal of a percent, $\frac{1}{p\%}$, means the reciprocal of a ratio. If a percent $p\%$ means the part over the total, i.e. there are $p$ part units per group of $100$ total units, then $\frac{1}{p\%}$ means that there are $100$ total units per group of $p$ part units.

## Irrational numbers (Números irracionales)

The irrational numbers form the set of numbers such as $\pi$, in which the decimal part of the number is infinite and never repeats itself. The square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is also irrational.

The fact that they are called irrational, doesn't necessarily mean that they can't have predictable patterns, for example, a number such as $0.101001000100001000001...$ is irrational by definition, but it can be understood as the number with a $1$ in between a steady growing number of $0$s. This pattern is infinite and never repeats itself, so it's an irrational number.

## Real numbers (Números reales)

The set of real numbers is the union of the sets of rational and irrational numbers.

## Transcendental numbers (Números trascendentes)

The transcendental numbers are numbers that can't be obtained as a solution of a polynomial with rational coefficients.

For example $\sqrt{2}$ is not transcendental because it is the solution of $x^2 = 2$, which is a polynomial with rational coefficients.

(La constante pi)
**The pi constant**: the fraction of the circumference over the diameter. It's represented with the greek letter pi, which is $\pi$. The value of pi is roughly $\pi = 3.14159...$, this is a non repeating decimal. $\pi$ is a transcendental number because there is no polynomial with rational coefficients whose solution is $\pi$.

(Aproximación fraccionaria de pi)
**Fractional approximation of pi**: there are infinitely many fractional approximations of pi, one of the simplest is $\frac{22}{7}$.

## Number approximation (Aproximación de números)

(Redondeo)
**Rounding**: approximating a number with another of less significant digits.

(Función techo)
**Ceiling function**: a function that approximates a number to the nearest bigger integer. Denoted as $\lceil x \rceil$, where $x$ is the number being rounded, e.g. $\lceil 2.5 \rceil = 3$, $\lceil -2.5 \rceil = -2$.

(Función piso)
**Floor function**: a function that approximates a number to the nearest smaller integer. Denoted as $\lfloor x \rfloor$, where $x$ is the number being rounded, e.g. $\lfloor 2.5 \rfloor = 2$, $\lfloor -2.5 \rfloor = -3$.

(Truncamiento)
**Truncation**: rounding a number by removing all digits after the decimal point, e.g. $2.5$ truncated is $2$, and $-2.5$ truncated is $-2$.

## Equations and inequalities (Ecuaciones y desigualdades)

(Signo de igualdad)
**Equality sign**: this sign is $=$, the equal sign.

(Ecuación)
**Equation**: the math statement of two expressions that are equal, e.g. $a + b = c + d$

(Definición matemática)
**Math definition**: an equation in which a symbol is defined. The sign $:=$ is used to make definitions, to differentiate it from the equal sign. $a := b$ defines $a$ as $b$, this is read as $a$ is defined as $b$ ($a$ es definido como $b$).

(Fórmula matemática)
**Math formula**: an equation whose purpose is to find the value of a quantity or variable, i.e. formulas are equations expressly intended to find the value of a quantity, they are the "formula" to find said value, e.g. in $x = vt$ the distance $x$ is calculated as the product of velocity $v$ and time $t$.

(Operadores relacionales)
**Relational operators**: operators that compare the values of two numbers. These operators serve to make the set of numbers an ordered set, ordered according to the values of the numbers.

(Igualdad)
**Equality**: when the values of two quantities are equal, $a = b$ means the value of $a$ is equal to the value of $b$.

(Desigualdad)
**Inequality**: when the values of two quantities are strictly not equal, or may not be equal.

(Mayor que)
**Greater than**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is greater than the second. The operator is $>$, the greater than sign. $a > b$, read as $a$ greater than $b$ ($a$ mayor que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is greater than the value of $b$.

(Menor que)
**Less than**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is less than the second. The operator is $<$, the less than sign. $a < b$, read as $a$ less than $b$ ($a$ menor que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is less than the value of $b$.

(Mayor o igual que)
**Greater than or equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is greater than or equal to the second. The operator is $\ge$, the greater than or equal to sign. $a \ge b$, read as $a$ greater than or equal to $b$ ($a$ mayor o igual que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is greater than or equal to the value of $b$.

(Menor o igual que)
**Less than or equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is less than or equal to the second. The operator is $\le$, the less than or equal to sign. $a \le b$, read as $a$ less than or equal to $b$ ($a$ menor o igual que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is less than or equal to the value of $b$.

(Diferente a)
**not equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where they have different values. The operator is $\ne$, the not equal to sign. $a \ne b$, read as $a$ not equal to $b$ ($a$ diferente a $b$), means that the value of $a$ is not equal to the value of $b$.

(Solución de una ecuación)
**Solution of an equation**: an equation that contains a variable can be solved by determining the value of the variable that makes the equation true, e.g. in $x + 7 = 11$, $x$ must be $4$ so that the equation is true, and $4$ is the solution of the equation. An equation with several variables has solution tuples, e.g. an equation with three variables, $x$, $y$, and $z$, has solution tuples of size three, such as $(4, 3, 8)$.

(Despejar una variable)
**Isolate a variable**: using properties of equality, to make a variable stand alone in one side of an equation, e.g. $4 + y/2 = x + 1 \Rightarrow y = 2x - 6$, here the variable $y$ is isolated.

(Propiedad aditiva de la igualdad)
**Addition property of equality**: adding a number to both sides of an equality preserves the equality. Given $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$.

(Propiedad sustractiva de la igualdad)
**Subtraction property of equality**: subtracting a number from both sides of an equality preserves the equality. Given $a = b$, then $a - c = b - c$.

(Propiedad multiplicativa de la igualdad)
**Multiplication property of equality**: multiplying a number to both sides of an equality preserves the equality. Given $a = b$, then $a \cdot c = b \cdot c$.

(Propiedad divisiva de la igualdad)
**Division property of equality**: dividing both sides of an equality by a nonzero number preserves the equality. Given $a = b$ and $c \ne 0$, then $\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$.

(Proporción)
**Proportion**: an equation in which two fractions (ratios or rates) are equated. Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero, then $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ is a proportion, it's read as $a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$ ($a$ es a $b$ como $c$ es a $d$).

(Producto cruzado)
**Cross product**: a proportion where the denominators have been multiplied in both sides, i.e. in the proportion $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, the cross product is $ad = cb$. This concept is used to test if a proportion is true without dividing.

(Proporción con porcentajes)
**Percent proportion**: a proportion in which one of the fractions is a percentage. Using terms from before, let $B$ be the base, $A$ the amount, then $\frac{A}{B} = \frac{p}{100}$, this means that the amount $A$ is to the base $B$ as $p$ is to $100$.

## Addition of real numbers (Adición de números reales)

Addition is the operation of adding numbers together. Addition means starting at the end of the first number, and then moving the amount being added by the second number.

Addition is the inverse operation of subtraction. Given that addition means after the first number move the amount of the second, commutativity means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the end position is the same.

Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting its opposite (just as adding a positive number is the same as subtracting its opposite). If the number being added is positive then the addition moves in the positive direction, if the number being added is negative then the addition moves in the negative direction.

(Operador suma)
**Sum operator**: this operator is $+$, the plus sign.

(Notación de la suma)
**Addition notation**: the addition of $a$ and $b$ is $a + b = c$, read as $a$ plus $b$ ($a$ más $b$), $a$, $b$ are called the addends (sumandos), the result $c$ is called the sum (suma).

(Propiedad de identidad de la suma)
**Identity property of addition**: adding to zero doesn't change the number, $a + 0 = a$

(Identidad aditiva)
**Additive identity**: The number 0.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la suma)
**Commutative property of addition**: changing the order of the addends doesn't change the sum, $a + b = b + a$.

(Propiedad asociativa de la adición)
**Associative property of addition**: using grouping symbols to group addition operations does not change the sum, $a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.

(Inverso aditivo)
**Additive inverse**: the opposite of a number, is its additive inverse. The additive inverse of a number $a$ is $-a$.

(Propiedad inversa aditiva)
**Inverse property of addition**: the sum of a number and its additive inverse is zero, $a + (-a) = a - a = 0$.

(Símbolo de sumatoria)
**Summation symbol**: the symbol $\sum_i$ that represents the sum of the elements of the set to which $i$ belongs, e.g. $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_i} = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$, where $1, 2, ..., n$ is the set of values of $i$ over which the summation is done.

(Adición de fracciones con denominador común)
**Addition of fractions with common denominators**: the same as normal addition. It must be noted that $\frac{a}{b} = a\frac{1}{b}$, which means that $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{b} = a\frac{1}{b} + c\frac{1}{b} = (a + c)\frac{1}{b} = \frac{a + c}{b}$.

(Adición de fracciones con denominador diferente)
**Addition of fractions with different denominators**: first the fractions being added must have common denominators, for this, each fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction such that its denominator is the common one. The common denominator can be found as the least common denominator of the fractions. The addition is done like regular addition when the denominators are common.

(Adición de números mixtos)
**Addition of mixed numbers**: like regular addition. The integer parts of the mixed numbers can be added directly, and the proper fraction parts are added with the rules of addition of fractions, the result is the sum of the integer and fraction parts. To show the result as a mixed number, the integer part is left alone, and the fraction part is converted to a proper fraction if necessary, this may change the integer part.

## Subtraction of real numbers (Sustracción de números reales)

Subtraction is the operation of subtracting a number from another. Subtraction means starting at the end of the first number, and then moving in the opposite direction the amount of units being subtracted by the second number.

Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition. Subtraction is not commutative.

Subtracting a negative number means moving opposite to its direction, i.e. moving in the positive direction. In $a - (-b)$ the expression $- (-b)$ subtracts negative $b$, so moving opposite to negative $b$ means adding positive $b$, and $a - (-b) = a + b$.

(Operador resta)
**Subtraction operator**: this operator is $-$, the minus sign.

(Notación de la resta)
**Subtraction notation**: the subtraction of $a$ from $b$ is $b - a = c$, read as $b$ minus $a$ ($b$ menos $a$), $b$ is called the minuend (minuendo), $a$ is called the subtrahend (sustraendo), the result $c$ is called the difference (diferencia)

(Sustracción de fracciones con denominador común)
**Subtraction of fractions with common denominators**: the same as normal subtraction. It must be noted that $\frac{a}{b} = a\frac{1}{b}$, which means that $\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{b} = a\frac{1}{b} - c\frac{1}{b} = (a - c)\frac{1}{b} = \frac{a - c}{b}$.

(Sustracción de fracciones con denominador diferente)
**Subtraction of fractions with different denominator**: first the fractions being subtracted must have common denominators, for this, each fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction such that its denominator is the common one. The common denominator can be found as the least common denominator of the fractions. The subtraction is done like regular subtraction when the denominators are common.

(Sustracción de números mixtos)
**Subtraction of mixed numbers**: like regular subtraction. The integer parts of the mixed numbers can be subtracted directly, and the proper fraction parts are subtracted with the rules of subtraction of fractions, the result is the difference of the integer and fraction parts. To show the result as a mixed number, the integer part is left alone, and the fraction part is converted to a proper fraction if necessary, this may change the integer part.

## Multiplication of real numbers (Multiplicación de números reales)

Multiplication is the operation of multiplying numbers together. Multiplication means the repeated addition of a number with itself, the amount of repeated additions is the other number in the operation.

Multiplication is the inverse operation of division. Given that multiplication means the repeated addition of the first number with itself a number of times equal to the second number, this means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the final repeated addition is the same.

When multiplying or dividing by a negative number, it changes the sign of the other number, so multiplying or dividing a negative number by another negative number results in a positive number, and multiplying or dividing a positive number by a negative number results in a negative number.

In a multiplication operation, if the amount of repeated additions is negative, then this means repeated addition with each addition done in the opposite direction. For example, $4 \cdot -3 = -4 -4 -4$, each addition is done in the opposite direction of $4$, and in $-4 \cdot -3 = 4 + 4 + 4$, each addition is done in the opposite direction of $-4$.

Multiplication by a number is the same as division by its reciprocal, $a \cdot b = a \div \frac{1}{b}$, because it follows the definition of division as repeated subtraction. Starting from $a$, to reach 0 by subtracting $\frac{1}{b}$, it must be done $a \cdot b$ times, this is because to reach 0 by subtracting $1$ it is done $a$ times, $\frac{a}{1} = a$, and to do it by subtracting $\frac{1}{b}$, it must be done $b$ times as much.

(Operador multiplicación)
**Multiplication operator**: this operator is $\times$, the times sign. Another is $\cdot$, the dot sign. Another is $()$, the parentheses signs.

(Notación de la multiplicación)
**Multiplication notation**: the multiplication of $a$ and $b$ is $a \cdot b = c$, read as $a$ times $b$ ($a$ veces $b$), $a$, $b$ are called the factors (factores), the result $c$ is called the product (producto).

(Propiedad anulativa de la multiplicación)
**Multiplication property of zero**: the product of any number multiplied by 0, is 0, $a \cdot 0 = 0$.

(Propiedad modulativa de la multiplicación)
**Identity property of multiplication**: the product of any number multiplied by 1, is the number itself, $a \cdot 1 = a$.

(Identidad multiplicativa | elemento neutro | elemento identidad)
**Multiplicative identity**: The number 1.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la multiplicación)
**Commutative property of multiplication**: changing the order of the factors doesn't change the product, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.

(Propiedad asociativa de la multiplicación)
**Associative property of multiplication**: using grouping symbols to group multiplication operations does not change the product, $a \cdot b \cdot c = (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.

(Propiedad distributiva de la multiplicación respecto a la suma)
**Distributive property of multiplication over addition**: when a group of addends (grouped using a grouping symbol) is multiplied by a number, it's the same as the sum of the products of said number by each addend, $a (b + c) = a b + a c$.

This property shows itself when multiplying $a$ by the sum $b + c$, the resulting product can be seen as the sum of $a b$ and $a c$. This property actually includes subtraction as a case of the sum, given that the addends can be negative numbers.

(Inverso multiplicativo)
**Multiplicative inverse**: the reciprocal of a number, is its multiplicative inverse. The multiplicative inverse of a number $a$ is $\frac{1}{a}$.

(Propiedad inversa de la multiplicación)
**Inverse property of multiplication**: the product of a number and its multiplicative inverse is one, $a \frac{1}{a} = 1$.

(Multiplicación por -1)
**Multiplication by -1**: a number multiplied by $-1$ results in its opposite, $-1 \cdot a = -a$. Using the definition of multiplication, multiplying $a$ by $-1$ is the same as adding $a$ one time in its opposite direction, which is $-a$, the opposite of $a$.

(Multiplicación por 0)
**Multiplication by 0**: the product of any number and 0 is 0, $a \cdot 0 = 0$. This is because $a$ is added $0$ times with itself.

(Multiplicación de fracciones)
**Fraction multiplication**: the product of two fractions is the product of the numerators over the product of the denominators, $\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \cdot c}{b \cdot d}$, this implies two operations, first the multiplication by $c$ and then the division by $d$. Given the PEMDAS order of operations, it's the same if the division by $d$ is done first.

(Multiplicación de decimales)
**Multiplication of decimals**: in the product of decimal numbers, the amount of decimal digits is up to the sum of the decimal digits in the factors.

(Multiplicación y división por 10)
**Multiplication and division by 10**: given that 10 is the base of the decimal place value system, multiplying a number by 10 moves the number one digit to the left, while dividing a number by 10 moves the number one digit to the right. For example, $2 \cdot 10 = 20$, and $2 \div 10 = 0.2$.

(Paradigma de la multiplicación y división)
**Multiplication and division paradigm**: multiplication and division both deal with three concepts: a set of elements, groups of elements, and the size of said groups. Each of this concepts is associated with a number, the total number of elements, the amount of groups, and the size of each group.

Multiplication returns the total number of elements as the product of the amount of groups by the size of each group. For example, $5$ groups of size $4$, have a total number of elements of $5 \cdot 4 = 20$, and $4$ groups each with $5$ elements, have a total number of elements of $4 \cdot 5 = 20$. By itself, the total number of elements remains the same, $20$.

In multiplication, the amount of groups is interchangeable with the size of each group, so a multiplication can be interpreted as the amount of groups times their size, or as the size of the groups times the amount of groups, both interpretations are valid for any single multiplication.

Division has a similar behavior, the total number of elements is the dividend, but then, the divisor can be any of the other two numbers. The divisor can be the amount of groups, or the size of each group, and the quotient is the other number. For example, $24 \div 8 = 3$ means, from the $24$ total elements, with groups of size $8$, then there are $3$ groups, but $24 \div 8 = 3$ also means that from the $24$ total elements, with $8$ groups, each will have a size of $3$. Both conclusions are arrived via repeated subtraction.

The interpretation of $24 \div 8 = 3$ as $24$ elements divided in $8$ groups have a group size of $3$, means that there are $3$ elements per each $1$ group, so $24 \div 8 = 3 \div 1$, in words it could be read as, there are $24$ elements each $8$ groups, or there are $3$ elements each $1$ group.

## Division of real numbers (División de números reales)

Division is the operation of dividing a first number by a second number. Division means the repeated subtraction of the second number from the first number until reaching 0, the amount of repeated subtractions is the result of the operation.

Division is the inverse operation of Multiplication. Division is not commutative.

If the amount of repeated subtractions is negative, then this means repeated subtraction with each subtraction done in the opposite direction. For example, $24 \div -8 = -3$ so the number $-8$ is subtracted $-3$ times from $24$, i.e. $-8$ is subtracted three times in its opposite direction to reach 0 starting at 24. In $-24 \div -8 = 3$ the amount of repeated subtractions is positive, so $-8$ is subtracted directly from $-24$ three times to reach 0.

Division by a number is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal, $\frac{a}{b} = a \cdot \frac{1}{b}$, because having $a$ elements divided in $b$ groups, has each group with size $\frac{a}{b}$, and adding $a$ with itself only a fraction $\frac{1}{b}$ times, ends being at the same place of $\frac{a}{b}$.

(Operador división)
**Division operator**: this operator is $\div$, the division sign. Another is $/$, the slash sign. Another is $\text{---}$, the horizontal line sign.

(Notación de la división)
**Division notation**: the division of $b$ over $a$ is $\frac{b}{a} = c$, read as $b$ divided by $a$ ($b$ dividido $a$), $b$ is called the dividend (dividendo), $a$ is called the divisor (divisor), the result $c$ is called the quotient (cociente).

(Propiedad modulativa de la división)
**Identity property of division**: the quotient of any number divided by 1, is the number itself, $\frac{a}{1} = a$.

(Identidad divisiva)
**Divisive identity**: The number 1.

(Propiedad del cociente uno de la división)
**Division property of quotient one**: any non zero number divided by itself gives a quotient of 1, $\frac{a}{a} = 1$.

(Propiedades del cero en la división)
**Division properties of zero**: zero divided by any nonzero number is zero, $\frac{0}{a} = 0$. Division by zero is undefined, $\frac{a}{0}\ is\ undef$.

(División por -1)
**Division by -1**: a number divided by $-1$ results in its opposite, $a \div -1 = -a$. Using the definition of division, dividing $a$ by $-1$ is the same as subtracting $-1$ from $a$ until reaching 0, which is $-a$ times, the opposite of $a$.

(Recíproco de un número)
**Reciprocal of a number**: given a number, its reciprocal is another number such that when multipled together the product is 1. In $\frac{a}{b}$, the reciprocal is $\frac{b}{a}$, because $\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a} = \frac{a \cdot b}{b \cdot a} = 1$, and so $a \ne 0$, $b \ne 0$, which means that 0 doesn't have a reciprocal.

Non fraction numbers also have a reciprocal, the reciprocal of $a$ is $\frac{1}{a}$ because $a \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 1$. Using the definition of division, $\frac{1}{a}$ means taking the number $1$ and dividing it into $a$ groups, then $\frac{1}{a}$ is the size of each group, which is the same as the place where the first group ends, this place is the definition of the reciprocal of $a$.

(Invertir un número)
**Invert a number**: the process of finding the reciprocal of a number. When a number is inverted the result is its reciprocal.

(División de fracciones)
**Fraction division**: the operation $\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}$. This implies two operations, division by $c$ and division by the reciprocal of $d$ which is the same as multiplication by $d$, so $\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \cdot d}{b \cdot c}$.

(Residuo | Resto)
**Remainder**: in division, this is the number that is left over after doing the repeated subtraction, if any. In $\frac{a}{b} = q + \frac{r}{b}$, $a$, $b$ are numbers with $b$ being nonzero, $q$ is the quotient, and $r$ is the remainder.

## Exponentiation of real numbers (Exponenciación de números reales)

(Notación exponencial)
**Exponential notation**: used in expressions where a number is multiplied by itself several times, for example, $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$ is written as $2^4$. In general $a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a = a^n$, where the value $n$ is the amount of times that $a$ is multiplied by itself.

Using the shown symbols, the exponential notation is read as $a$ to the $n$-th power ($a$ a la $n$-ésima potencia), also read as $a$ to the power of $n$ ($a$ a la $n$). The operation itself is read as raise $a$ to the $n$-th power (elevar $a$ a la $n$-ésima potencia), also read as raise $a$ to the power of $n$ (elevar $a$ a la $n$).

(Potenciación)

(Números al cuadrado)
**Squared numbers**: when a number is raised to the power of 2, it is said that the result is a squared number, e.g. $3$ to the power of $2$ is $9$, or $3$ squared is $9$ ($3$ al cuadrado es $9$).

(Cuadrado perfecto)
**Perfect square**: any whole number that is the square of an integer. For example $9$ is the perfect square of $3$, because $3^2 = 9$ and $\sqrt{9} = 3$.

(Números al cubo)
**Cubed numbers**: when a number is raised to the power of 3, it is said that the result is a cubed number, e.g. $5$ to the power of $3$ is $125$, or $5$ cubed is $125$ ($5$ al cubo es $125$).

(Radicación de números)
**Taking a root of a number**: the exponentiation operation using as exponent the reciprocal of an integer, e.g. $a^{1/7}$ in which the exponent is the reciprocal of $7$, this is read as taking the seventh root of $a$ (sacar la raíz séptima de $a$).

(Signo de radical)
**Radical sign**: The symbol around $n$ in $\sqrt{n}$ is the radical sign, it acts as a grouping symbol for the expression inside it. $\sqrt{n} = n^{1/2}$, and $\sqrt[7]{n} = n^{1/7}$, in general $\sqrt[k]{n} = n^{1/k}$.

(Raíz cuadrada)
**Square root**: given two numbers $m$, $n$, such that $m = n^2$, then $n$ is the square root of $m$, $n = \sqrt{m}$. Squared numbers can be seen as squares in a 2D grid. Let $m$ be the area of a given square, then $n$ is the measure of its side's length.

(Raíz cuadrada principal)
**Principal square root**: since any square root can be negative or positive, because $n^2 = (-n)^2 = m$, so both $n$ and $-n$ are roots of $m$, only one is chosen as the square root of $m$, this is the positive value $n$, named the principal square root of $m$, $\sqrt{m}$ stands for $n$.

## Order of operations (Orden de las operaciones)

The order in which to execute the operations. In $5 + \frac{10}{2}$, the result is $10$ if division is done first, but the result is $7.5$ if addition is done first. This can be modified with grouping symbols.

(Signos de agrupación)
**Grouping symbols**: symbols that act as operators by grouping algebraic symbols. The grouped symbols are operated together. The grouping symbols serve to make explicit the order of operations.

(Paréntesis)
**Parentheses**: this operator is $()$, the parentheses signs. $8(14 - 8)$ returns $48$.

(Corchetes)
**Brackets**: this operator is $[]$, the brackets signs. $21 - 3[2 + 4(9 - 8)]$ returns $3$.

(Llaves)
**Braces**: this operator is $\{\}$, the braces signs. $24 \div \{13 - 2[(6 - 5) + 4]\}$ returns $8$.

(PEMDAS)
**PEMDAS**: acronym of Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. This dictates the standard order of operations when there are no parentheses, or grouping symbols in general. Multiplication and division have the same relevance, so they can be switched in order, same with addition and subtraction.

## Properties of real numbers (Propiedades de los números reales)

(Valor absoluto)
**Absolute value**: the distance between 0 and a given number, it's always positive and it's the same for any number and its opposite. For a given number $a$, its absolute value is denoted as $\lvert a \rvert$, e.g. $\lvert 5 \rvert = \lvert -5 \rvert = 5$.

## Multiples and factors of integers (Múltiplos y factores de los enteros)

(Múltiplos de un número)
**Multiples of an number**: given an integer, its multiples are the result of multiplying it by any of the counting numbers, so an integer has infinite multiples. The smallest multiple (in absolute value) is the integer itself.

(Divisibilidad)
**Divisibility**: if a given integer $b$ is multiple of another $a$, then $b$ is divisible by $a$, because $\frac{b}{a}$ is an integer. All the multiples of $a$ are divisible by $a$.

A given integer is divisible by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8.
A given integer is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
A given integer is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.
A given integer is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits (i.e. the first digit, minus the second, plus the third, minus the fourth, etc.) is divisible by 11.

(Factores de un número)
**Factors of a number**: in a given integer, its factors are the integers that multiplied together produce it. An integer can have several different sets of factors, e.g. $12$ has different sets of factors like $3$, $4$, also $2$, $6$, or $2$, $3$, $2$, or others.

(Pares de factores)
**factor pairs**: factors can always be presented in pairs, because at least two integers are required to be multiplied together in order to produce a given integer. In the example of $12 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$, with factor pairs the equation would be $12 = 2 \cdot 6$ or $12 = 3 \cdot 4$.

(Números primos)
**Prime numbers**: each of the integers with only 2 different factors, the number 1 and the integer itself.

(Números compuestos)
**Composite numbers**: the numbers that are not prime, i.e. the integers that have more than one factor pair.

**prime factors**: the set of prime numbers that multiplied together produce a given integer. Integers can be represented as the product of prime factors.

(Descomposición en factores primos)
**Prime factorization**: the process of finding the prime factors of a number.

(Multiplicidad de un factor primo)
**Multiplicity of a prime factor**: the amount of times that a prime factor of a given number is repeated, e.g. in the number $60$ the prime factors are $2$, $2$, $3$, $5$, the number $2$ has a multiplicity of $2$, the number $3$ has a multiplicity of $1$, and the number $5$ has a multiplicity of $1$.

(Múltiplos comunes)
**Common multiples**: given a set of at least two integers, the common multiples are the numbers that are multiples of all the integers in the set.

(Mínimo común múltiplo)
**Least common multiple**: the smallest common multiple of a given set of at least two integers.

The least common multiple of two integers can be calculated using their prime factors. The least common multiple of two integers is the product of all their unique prime factors, each raised to the power of their maximum multiplicity.

For example, to find the least common multiple of $12$ and $18$, the prime factors of $12$ are $2$, $2$, $3$, and the prime factors of $18$ are $2$, $3$, $3$. The least common multiple is $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 36$, the number $2$ has a maximum multiplicity of $2$ (in $12$), and $3$ has a maximum multiplicity of $2$ (in $18$).

(Mínimo común denominador)
**Least common denominator**: the least common multiple of the denominators from a set of at least two fractions.

(Máximo común divisor)
**Greatest common divisor**: the biggest common divisor of a given set of at least two integers.

In this use of the term "divisor", it is also a factor of the set of numbers. That's why sometimes this is also called greatest common factor (Máximo factor común).

The greatest common divisor of two integers can be calculated using their prime factors. The greatest common divisor of two integers is the product of their common prime factors, each raised to the power of their minimum multiplicity.

## Algebra definitions (Definiciones de álgebra)

(Expresión algebraica)
**Algebraic expression**: an expression that uses symbols, it may or may not represent constant values as symbols too, e.g. $x + 7$ or $x + a$.

(Términos algebraicos)
**Algebraic terms**: each of the parts of an algebraic expression separated by a plus or minus, so numbers and symbols multiplied together count as a term, e.g. in $3a + 7 + x^2$ there are three terms, $3a$, $7$, and $x^2$.

(Coeficiente)
**Coefficient**: the numeric constant that multiplies the variable(s) in a term. If a term has no variables then the coefficient is the term itself. If a variable has no numeric constant then the implied coefficient is 1. For example, in $3a + 7 + x^2$, the coefficients are $3$, $7$, and $1$, respectively.

(Términos semejantes)
**Like terms**: terms that can be added together directly, like terms can only differ from each other in the coefficient, so their symbol(s) (variable or constant) has to be the same, e.g. $3x$ and $4x$ are like terms, they may be added (or subtracted) directly.

(Reducción de términos semejantes)
**Combining like terms | Combine like terms**: simplification in which like terms are combined, i.e. they are added together according to their sign, e.g. $3x + 4x$ can be combined as $7x$, $3x - 4x$ can be combined as $-x$.

## Linear equations (Ecuaciones lineales)

(elevación sobre avance de una pendiente)
**rise over run of a slope**: in a slope, rise over run is the fraction of the vertical distance called "rise" over the horizontal distance called "run".

## Simplifications (Simplificaciones)

(Reducir fracciones)
**Reduce fractions**: form of simplification in which a fraction is expressed as an equivalent fraction that has no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. If there is a common factor, both the numerator and the denominator are divided by it, this simplifies the fraction.

For example $\frac{6}{9} = \frac{4}{6}$, but their reduced form is $\frac{2}{3}$. In $\frac{6}{9}$ a common factor is $3$ and dividing the numerator and denominator by $3$ results in $\frac{2}{3}$. In $\frac{4}{6}$ a common factor is $2$ and dividing the numerator and denominator by $2$ results in $\frac{2}{3}$.

The same simplification can be done with variables, e.g. $\frac{2 \cdot x}{x}$ can be simplified to $\frac{2}{1}$ or $2$.

(Fracción irreducible)
**Simplified fraction**: a fraction in which the numerator and the denominator have no common factors.

(Conversión entre decimales y fracciones)
**Conversion between decimals and fractions**: decimals can be presented in fraction form, and vice versa. The conversion from fraction to decimal is done by performing the division of the numerator over the denominator of the fraction. The conversion from finite decimal to fraction is done by multiplying the decimal by 10 to the positive power of the place of the rightmost digit, and dividing the result over the same power of 10.

(Conversión de decimal periódico a fracción)
**Conversion from repeating decimal to fraction**: The conversion from repeating decimal to fraction is done by creating two numbers, each of which is the product of the decimal by a different power of 10, and then subtracting both numbers and dividing that difference by the subtraction of said powers of 10 (See Programs/Ch05/S03_01_Repeating_decimals.py).

Repeating decimals have a few parts, for example, in the number $894.57448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, the unique part (parte única) is $894.57$, and the repeating part (parte periódica) is $448132653$. In itself, the unique part has two parts (as any decimal number), the decimal part and the integer part.

For the unique part $894.57$, the original number is multiplied by 10 to the positive power of the place of the rightmost digit of the unique part, in this case $10^2$. For the repeating part, the original number is multiplied by 10 to the power of the sum of the amount of repeating digits and the power of 10 used for the unique part (in this case $2$). The amount of digits in $448132653$ is $9$, so for the repeating part, the original number is multiplied by $10^{9 + 2} = 10^{11}$.

Now to subtract these two products, let $a = 894.57448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, so $a 10^2 = 89457.448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, and $a 10^{11} = 89457448132653.448132653448132653448132653448132653448132653$, therefore $a 10^{11} - a 10^2 = 89457448043196$, as can be seen, this subtraction results in an integer. Continuing, $a 10^{11} - a 10^2 = a (10^{11} - 10^2)$, so $a = \frac{89457448043196}{(10^{11} - 10^2)} = \frac{89457448043196}{99999999900}$.

(Conversión entre porcentajes y decimales, y entre porcentajes y fracciones)
**Conversion between percents and decimals, and between percents and fractions**: the conversion from percent to fraction and decimal uses the definition of percent. Given that a percent is a ratio with denominator 100, the fraction is the percent number over 100, and the decimal is the result of the division of said fraction. For example, $54\%$ as a fraction is $\frac{54}{100}$, and as a decimal is $0.54$.

The conversion from decimal or fraction to percent is based on equivalent fractions. The decimal is converted to a fraction, and the fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100. For example the decimal $0.6$ as a fraction is $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$, and then as an equivalent fraction $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \cdot 20}{5 \cdot 20} = \frac{60}{100} = 60\%$.

A decimal can be converted directly to a percent, by multiplying it for $100$, e.g. $0.6 = 0.6 \cdot 100 \% = 60\%$. The opposite consists in dividing a percent by $100$ to obtain its decimal form.

When handling improper fractions, the resulting percent is greater than $100\%$, for example $\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 = 1.25 \cdot 100\% = 125\%$.

## Measures of central tendency (Medidas de tendencia central)

(Promedios)
**Averages**: measures of the typical number in a set of numbers. A typical number is that which is most likely to appear from the set, or one that has a value in the middle of the values of the set. The measure of an average itself doesn't have to be part of the set of numbers, so a number that is not in the set, could be a representative value for said set.

(La media)
**The mean**: also called the arithmetic average (la media aritmética), it's the sum of a set of numbers divided by the size of the set. Let $X$ be a set of $N$ numbers, $x_i$ be the $i$-th number in the set, $\bar{x}$ be the mean of the set, then $\bar{x} = \sum_i{\frac{x_i}{N}}$.

(Mediana)
**Median**: the middle value in a set of numbers, such that half the numbers are greater than the median, and the other half is less than the median. After sorting the set, when the set contains an odd amount of numbers, the median is the value in the middle, and when the set has an even amount of numbers, the median is the mean of the two values in the middle.

(Moda)
**Mode**: the number with the highest frequency in a set. A set of numbers can have several modes if several numbers have the same highest frequency, or none if all the numbers have the same frequency.

**Frequency of a number in a set**: the amount of times a given number is repeated in a set.

(Probabilidad de un evento)
**Probability of an event**: the fraction of the number of times an event happens over the number of general outcomes with or without the event.

For example, in a set of $N$ numbers, the probability $P(x)$ to obtain a given number $x$ that has a frequency of $f_x$ is $P(x) = \frac{f_x}{N}$.

## Science and engineering definitions (Definiciones de ciencia e ingeniería)

(Ratio)
**Ratio**: a fraction of any two numbers that are measured with the same unit or scale, therefore ratios have no units themselves. For example the ratio of height to width, both are measured in distance.

The notation of ratios in particular, includes the use of the colon : symbol to replace the division symbol. So the ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ can be denoted as $a:b$. If $b = 1$ then the ratio is still presented as $\frac{a}{1}$, and if the ratio is an improper fraction, it is not converted to a mixed number.

(Tasa)
**Rate**: a fraction of any two numbers that are measured in differente units or scales, so the unit of a rate is the fraction of the units. For example the rate of speed which is measured as a fraction of distance over time.

Ratios can be considered rates when the particular units in the numerator and denominator are also considered, even though they are the same. For example, width over height can be seen as a ratio, but also as the rate of width per unit of height, this rate is still dimensionless like a ratio.

(Tasa unitaria)
**Unit rate**: a rate expressed with a denominator of $1$.

(Precio unitario)
**Unit price**: a unit rate in which the unit is $\text{\textdollar}/unit$, it tells the price per unit.

(Porcentaje de aumento, porcentaje de disminución)
**Percent increase, percent decrease**: in general, the percent change (porcentaje de cambio) from a variable is measured as the difference of final value minus initial value, divided over the initial value, this result tells the amount of units changed per group of $1$ unit before change, and this can be converted to a percent.

Let $V_i$ be the initial value of a given variable, $V_f$ be the final value of said variable, $\Delta p\%$ be the percent change, then $\Delta p\% = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} 100\%$. Note that the words "initial" and "final" do not have to mean that they are separated in time, they can be separated under any criteria wanted.

Given that $V_f$ can be smaller or bigger than $V_i$, $\Delta p\%$ can be negative or positive, if it's negative then that means that the percent change is a percent decrease, whereas if it's positive then that means that the percent change is a percent increase.

(Sistemas de medida)
**Systems of measurement**: The systems of measurement are systems intended to be internally consistent, to provide a unit of measure for any physical quantity. The main quantities measured in these systems are time and space (time, distance, area, volume), derived quantities are also included like speed (distance divided by time), and also units of measure for other quantities, like electric field, radiation levels, etcetera.

There are two main systems of measurement used at the time of this writing, the U.S. system and the international metric system.

(Conversión de unidades)
**Unit conversion**: changing the units of a measure. Unit conversion is based on multiplying the unit to be changed by $1$, but writing $1$ in such a way that it changes the unit of measure. In general, given the units of measure $unit1$ and $unit2$, and given $A\ unit1 = B\ unit2$ meaning that $A$ units of $unit1$ are equal in measure to $B$ units of $unit2$, so $1 = \frac{B\ unit2}{A\ unit1}$, and also $1 = \frac{A\ unit1}{B\ unit2}$. These fractions are called conversion factors (factores de conversión).

Using real units, $1\ foot = 12\ inches$, so $1 = \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches}$, and $1 = \frac{12\ inches}{1\ foot}$. The fraction chosen to do the unit conversion is the one that divides the unit being changed, so, the one that has the unit being changed in the denominator. For example, to convert $60\ inches$ to $feet$, the conversion factor must have $inches$ in the denominator, $60\ inches \cdot \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} = 5 feet$.

Several conversions can be made one after the other, for example, $60\ inches \cdot \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} \cdot \frac{1\ yard}{3\ feet} = \frac{5}{3}\ yard$.

(Conversión entre sistemas de medida)
**Conversion between systems of measurement**: units of measure can be converted from one system to another by having their equivalencies (equivalencias), and then performing regular unit conversion using said equivalencies.

The following table contains a few of the equivalencies between units in the U.S. customary units system and units in the international metric system. The values presented in the table are approximations.

| Equivalencies   |
| :------------:  |
| **Length**      |
| 1 in = 2.54 cm  |
| 1 ft = 0.305 m  |
| 1 yd = 0.914 m  |
| 1 mi = 1.61 km  |
| **Weight**      |
| 1 lb = 0.45 kg  |
| 1 oz = 28 g     |
| **Volume**      |
| 1 qt = 0.95 L   |
| 1 fl oz = 30 mL |

(Unidades de medida mixtas)
**Mixed units of measurement**: units of measure that are combined together to measure a single quantity. For example, using hours and minutes together to measure time.

When handling mixed units of measurement, each separate unit is added or subtracted separately. In the case of using hours and minutes together, for example $3\ hours, 12\ minutes$ plus $2\ hours, 20\ minutes$ is $5\ hours, 32\ minutes$, because hours and minutes are added separately. In this particular case, any amount of minutes over 60 is converted to hours accordingly, and in general the smaller unit is converted to the bigger unit if needed.

(Conversión Fahrenheit Celsius)
**Fahrenheit Celsius conversion**: two formulas that allow converting temperature (temperatura) measured in the Fahrenheit scale to the Celsius scale, and vice versa, Let $C$ be the temperature in Celsius, $F$ be the temperature in Fahrenheit, then $C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$ and $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$.

(Interés simple)
**Simple interest**: The simple interest is a way to calculate the amount of interest to be received for an investment or paid for a loan.

(Principal de una inversión)
**Investment principal**: the amount of money put into an investment.

(Principal de un préstamo)
**Loan principal**: the amount of money borrowed as a loan.

(Interés financiero)
**Financial interest**: money received in return for an investment, or paid for a loan.

## Science and engineering formulas (Fórmulas de ciencia e ingeniería)

(Fórmula de tiempo en caída libre)
**Free fall time formula**: formula to find the fall time in a free fall scenario. The fall starts at a given height, and the time calculated by this formula is the time from the moment the fall starts, to the moment of reaching the ground.

Let $t$ be the fall time in time units, $h$ be the starting height in length units, $g$ be the standard gravity (gravedad estándar), then $t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot h}{g}}$.

(Fórmula de la velocidad antes de frenar)
**Formula of the speed before braking**: formula to find the speed of a car before braking, from the length of the skid mark. Let $d$ be the skid mark distance in feet, $v$ be the speed of the car before braking in miles per hour, then $v = \sqrt{24 \cdot d}$.

(Impuesto de ventas)
**Sales tax**: percent applied to the price of a good or service (bien o servicio), the resulting amount of which is paid as taxes. Let $P_i$ be the price before taxes in monetary units, $P$ be the price with sales tax in monetary units, and $t$ be the sales tax as a ratio, then $P = P_i + t P_i$. The term $t P_i$ is hold as taxes by businesses, and then paid to the government.

(Comisión por ventas)
**Sales commission**: extra wage paid to a sales person for the value sold by them. Let $C$ be the commission earned by the sales person in monetary units, $P$ be the sales value of the goods or services sold in monetary units, and $c$ be the commission rate (tasa de comisión) as a ratio, then $C = c P$. The commission rate $c$ is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit sold that becomes commission.

(Descuento de precio)
**Price discount**: reduction in the price of a good or service, to make it more attractive for clients to buy. Let $D$ be the amount of discount in monetary units, $P_i$ be the regular price in monetary units, $P$ be the price after discount in monetary units, $d$ be the discount rate (tasa de descuento) as a ratio, then $D = d P_i$ and $P = P_i - D = P_i - d P_i$. The discount rate $d$ is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit of the price that becomes discounted.

(Margen de ganancia)
**Mark-up**: retailers buy goods at a wholesale price (precio mayorista), and then resell said goods at a list price (precio de lista | precio sugerido). Their profit comes from the mark-up which is the extra price added to the wholesale price to obtain the list price. Let $W$ be the wholesale price of a good in monetary units, $M$ be the amount of mark-up in monetary units, $L$ be the list price in monetary units, and $m$ be the mark-up rate as a ratio, then $M = m W$ and $L = W + M = W + m W$. The mark-up rate is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit of the wholesale price that becomes mark-up.

(Fórmula del interés simple)
**Simple interest formula**: formula to calculate the simple interest from the loan principal, the interest rate, and the time elapsed since the loan started. Let $P$ be the principal of the investment or loan in monetary units, $I$ be the amount of interest in monetary units, $t$ be the time elapsed since the moment of the investment or loan in time units, and $r$ be the interest rate (tasa de interés) paid per period as a ratio, then $I = Prt$.
