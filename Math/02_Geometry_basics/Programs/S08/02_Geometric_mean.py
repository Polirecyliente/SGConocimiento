#T# the following code shows how to calculate the geometric mean of a set of numbers

#T# the statistics module has a function to calculate the geometric mean
import statistics

#T# calculate the geometric mean of a set of numbers with the geometric_mean function
list1 = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3]
num1 = statistics.geometric_mean(list1) # 1.197215767258376
