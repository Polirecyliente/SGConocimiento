## Definitions of percents (Definiciones de porcentajes)
[Ch06_S01](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=525)

(Porcentaje)
**Percent**: ratio with a denominator of 100. A percent number is identified with the percent sign $\%$ after it. For example $54\%$ means the ratio $\frac{54}{100}$.

(Conversión entre porcentajes y decimales, y entre porcentajes y fracciones)
**Conversion between percents and decimals, and between percents and fractions**: the conversion from percent to fraction and decimal uses the definition of percent. Given that a percent is a ratio with denominator 100, the fraction is the percent number over 100, and the decimal is the result of the division of said fraction. For example, $54\%$ as a fraction is $\frac{54}{100}$, and as a decimal is $0.54$.

The conversion from decimal or fraction to percent is based on equivalent fractions. The decimal is converted to a fraction, and the fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100. For example the decimal $0.6$ as a fraction is $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$, and then as an equivalent fraction $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \cdot 20}{5 \cdot 20} = \frac{60}{100} = 60\%$.

A decimal can be converted directly to a percent, by multiplying it for $100$, e.g. $0.6 = 0.6 \cdot 100 \% = 60\%$. The opposite consists in dividing a percent by $100$ to obtain its decimal form.

When handling improper fractions, the resulting percent is greater than $100\%$, for example $\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 = 1.25 \cdot 100\% = 125\%$.

## Percentage applications (Aplicaciones de porcentajes)
[Ch06_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=542)

(Partes de una ecuación de porcentaje)
**Parts of a percentage equation**: let $p\%$ be a percentage, $B$ be the base (la base), $A$ be the amount (la cantidad), then the simplest percentage equation is, $A = p\% \cdot B$, this expresses the amount $A$ as a percent of the base $B$.

Isolating the base allows finding its value from the amount and the percent, $B = \frac{A}{p\%}$.

The reciprocal of a percent, $\frac{1}{p\%}$, means the reciprocal of a ratio. If a percent $p\%$ means the fraction of the part over the total, i.e. there are $p$ part units per group of $100$ total units, then $\frac{1}{p\%}$ means that there are $100$ total units per group of $p$ part units.

Isolating the percent allows finding its value from the amount and the base, $p\% = \frac{A}{B}$.

(porcentaje de aumento, porcentaje de disminución)
**percent increase, percent decrease**: in general, the percent change (porcentaje de cambio) from a variable is measured as the difference of final value minus initial value, divided over the initial value, this result tells the amount of units changed per group of $1$ unit before change, and this can be converted to a percent.

Let $V_i$ be the initial value of a given variable, $V_f$ be the final value of said variable, $\Delta p\%$ be the percent change, then $\Delta p\% = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} \cdot 100\%$. Note that the words "initial" and "final" do not have to mean that they are separated in time, they can be separated under any criteria wanted.

Given that $V_f$ can be smaller, or bigger than $V_i$, then $\Delta p\%$ can be negative or positive, if it's negative that means that the percent change is a percent decrease, whereas if it's positive that means that the percent change is a percent increase.

## Sales tax, commissions, discounts (Impuesto de ventas, comisiones, descuentos)
[Ch06_S03](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=554)

(Impuesto de ventas)
**Sales tax**: percent applied to the price of a good or service (bien o servicio), the resulting amount of which is paid as taxes. Let $P_i$ be the price before taxes, $P$ be the price with taxes, and $t$ be the sales tax, then $P = P_i + t \cdot P_i$. The term $t \cdot P_i$ goes as taxes.

(Comisión por ventas)
**Sales commission**: extra wage paid to a sales person for the value sold by them. A basic form of commission is calculated as a commission rate (tasa de comisión) applied to the money value of the goods or services sold. Let $C$ be the commission earned by the sales person, $P$ be the sales value of the goods or services sold, and $c$ be the commission rate, then $C = c \cdot P$. The commission rate $c$ is commonly expressed as a percent.

(Descuento de precio)
**Price discount**: reduction in the price of a good or service, to make it more attractive to clients. A basic form of discount is calculated as a discount rate (tasa de descuento) applied to the sales price of the good or service. Let $D$ be the amount of discount, $P_i$ be the regular price, and $d$ be the discount rate, then $D = d \cdot P_i$. The discount rate $d$ is commonly expressed as a percent.

Using this definition of discount, let $P$ be the price after discount, then $P = P_i - D = P_i - d \cdot P_i$.

(Margen de ganancia)
**Mark-up**: retailers buy goods at a wholesale price (precio mayorista), and then resell said goods at a list price (precio de lista|precio sugerido). Their profit comes from the mark-up which is the extra price added to the wholesale price to obtain the list price. A simple mark-up policy is to use a mark-up rate and multiply it by the wholesale price to obtain the mark-up amount. Let $W$ be the wholesale price of a good, $M$ be the amount of mark-up, and $m$ be the mark-up rate, then $M = m \cdot W$. The mark-up rate is commonly expressed as a percent.

The list price is the result of adding the mark-up to the wholesale price. Let $L$ be the list price, then $L = M + W$.

## Simple interest (Interés simple)
[Ch06_S04](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=568)

(Principal de una inversión)
**Investment principal**: the amount of money put into an investment.

(Principal de un préstamo)
**Loan principal**: the amount of money borrowed as a loan.

(Interés financiero)
**Financial interest**: money received in return for an investment, or paid for a loan.

(Interés simple)
**Simple interest**: a way to calculate the amount of interest to be received for an investment or paid for a loan. Let $P$ be the principal of the investment or loan, $I$ be the amount of interest, $t$ be the time periods elapsed since the moment of the investment or loan, and $r$ be the interest rate (tasa de interés) paid per period, then $I = Prt$. This formula is the simple interest formula.
