(Porcentaje)
**Percent**: ratio with a denominator of 100. A percent number is identified with the percent sign $\%$ after it. For example $54\%$ means the ratio $\frac{54}{100}$.

(Conversión entre porcentajes y decimales, y entre porcentajes y fracciones)
**Conversion between percents and decimals, and between percents and fractions**: the conversion from percent to fraction and decimal uses the definition of percent. Given that a percent is a ratio with denominator 100, the fraction is the percent number over 100, and the decimal is the result of the division of said fraction. For example, $54\%$ as a fraction is $\frac{54}{100}$, and as a decimal is $0.54$.

The conversion from decimal or fraction to percent is based on equivalent fractions. The decimal is converted to a fraction, and the fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100. For example the decimal $0.6$ as a fraction is $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$, and then as an equivalent fraction $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \cdot 20}{5 \cdot 20} = \frac{60}{100} = 60\%$.

A decimal can be converted directly to a percent, by multiplying it for $100$, e.g. $0.6 = 0.6 \cdot 100 \% = 60\%$. The opposite consists in dividing a percent by $100$ to obtain its decimal form.

When handling improper fractions, the resulting percent is greater than $100\%$, for example $\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 = 1.25 \cdot 100\% = 125\%$.

## Percentage applications (Aplicaciones de porcentajes)

(Partes de una ecuación de porcentaje)
**Parts of a percentage equation**: let $p\%$ be a percentage, $B$ be the base (la base), $A$ be the amount (la cantidad), then the simplest percentage equation is, $A = p\% \cdot B$, this expresses the amount $A$ as a percent of the base $B$.

Isolating the base allows finding its value from the amount and the percent, $B = \frac{A}{p\%}$.

The reciprocal of a percent, $\frac{1}{p\%}$, means the reciprocal of a ratio. If a percent $p\%$ means the fraction of the part over the total, i.e. there are $p$ part units per group of $100$ total units, then $\frac{1}{p\%}$ means that there are $100$ total units per group of $p$ part units.

Isolating the percent allows finding its value from the amount and the base, $p\% = \frac{A}{B}$.

(porcentaje de aumento, porcentaje de disminución)
**percent increase, percent decrease**: in general, the percent change (porcentaje de cambio) from a variable is measured as the difference of final value minus initial value, divided over the initial value, this result tells the amount of units changed per group of $1$ unit before change, and this can be converted to a percent.

Let $V_i$ be the initial value of a given variable, $V_f$ be the final value of said variable, $\Delta p\%$ be the percent change, then $\Delta p\% = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} \cdot 100\%$. Note that the words "initial" and "final" do not have to mean that they are separated in time, they can be separated under any criteria wanted.

Given that $V_f$ can be smaller, or bigger than $V_i$, then $\Delta p\%$ can be negative or positive, if it's negative that means that the percent change is a percent decrease, whereas if it's positive that means that the percent change is a percent increase.
