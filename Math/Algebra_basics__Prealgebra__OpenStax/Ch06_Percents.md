## Definitions of percents (Definiciones de porcentajes)
[Ch06_S01](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=525)

(Porcentaje)
**Percent**: ratio with a denominator of 100. A percent number is identified with the percent sign $\%$ after it. For example $54\%$ means the ratio $\frac{54}{100}$.

(Conversión entre porcentajes y decimales, y entre porcentajes y fracciones)
**Conversion between percents and decimals, and between percents and fractions**: the conversion from percent to fraction and decimal uses the definition of percent. Given that a percent is a ratio with denominator 100, the fraction is the percent number over 100, and the decimal is the result of the division of said fraction. For example, $54\%$ as a fraction is $\frac{54}{100}$, and as a decimal is $0.54$.

The conversion from decimal or fraction to percent is based on equivalent fractions. The decimal is converted to a fraction, and the fraction is converted to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100. For example the decimal $0.6$ as a fraction is $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$, and then as an equivalent fraction $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \cdot 20}{5 \cdot 20} = \frac{60}{100} = 60\%$.

A decimal can be converted directly to a percent, by multiplying it for $100$, e.g. $0.6 = 0.6 \cdot 100 \% = 60\%$. The opposite consists in dividing a percent by $100$ to obtain its decimal form.

When handling improper fractions, the resulting percent is greater than $100\%$, for example $\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 = 1.25 \cdot 100\% = 125\%$.

## Percentage applications (Aplicaciones de porcentajes)
[Ch06_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=542)

(Ecuación de porcentaje)
**Percentage equation**: an equation that defines a percent. To define a percent, two concepts are needed, the base (la base) and the amount (la cantidad). The base is the number that represents the whole, and the amount is the number that represents the part or fraction of that whole.

> Parts of a percentage equation
>
> Let $p\%$ be a percent, $B$ be the base, $A$ be the amount, then
> $$A = p\% \cdot B$$

If $p < 100$, then $A < B$, which means that $A$ is a fraction of $B$.

Isolating the base allows finding its value from the amount and the percent, $B = \frac{A}{p\%}$.

The reciprocal of a percent, $\frac{1}{p\%}$, means the reciprocal of a ratio. If a percent $p\%$ means the part over the total, i.e. there are $p$ part units per group of $100$ total units, then $\frac{1}{p\%}$ means that there are $100$ total units per group of $p$ part units.

Isolating the percent allows finding its value from the amount and the base, $p\% = \frac{A}{B}$.

(porcentaje de aumento, porcentaje de disminución)
**percent increase, percent decrease**: in general, the percent change (porcentaje de cambio) from a variable is measured as the difference of final value minus initial value, divided over the initial value, this result tells the amount of units changed per group of $1$ unit before change, and this can be converted to a percent.

> Percent change notation
>
> Let $V_i$ be the initial value of a given variable, $V_f$ be the final value of said variable, $\Delta p\%$ be the percent change, then
> $$\Delta p\% = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} \cdot 100\%$$

Note that the words "initial" and "final" do not have to mean that they are separated in time, they can be separated under any criteria wanted.

Given that $V_f$ can be smaller or bigger than $V_i$, $\Delta p\%$ can be negative or positive, if it's negative then that means that the percent change is a percent decrease, whereas if it's positive then that means that the percent change is a percent increase.

## Sales tax, commissions, discounts (Impuesto de ventas, comisiones, descuentos)
[Ch06_S03](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=554)

(Impuesto de ventas)
**Sales tax**: percent applied to the price of a good or service (bien o servicio), the resulting amount of which is paid as taxes.

> Price with sales tax formula
>
> Let $P_i$ be the price before taxes in monetary units, $P$ be the price with sales tax in monetary units, and $t$ be the sales tax as a ratio, then
> $$P = P_i + t \cdot P_i$$

The term $t \cdot P_i$ is hold as taxes by businesses, and then paid to the government.

(Comisión por ventas)
**Sales commission**: extra wage paid to a sales person for the value sold by them.

> Basic commission formula
>
> Let $C$ be the commission earned by the sales person in monetary units, $P$ be the sales value of the goods or services sold in monetary units, and $c$ be the commission rate (tasa de comisión) as a ratio, then
> $$C = c \cdot P$$

The commission rate $c$ is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit sold that becomes commission.

(Descuento de precio)
**Price discount**: reduction in the price of a good or service, to make it more attractive for clients to buy.

> Basic discount formula
>
> Let $D$ be the amount of discount in monetary units, $P_i$ be the regular price in monetary units, $P$ be the price after discount in monetary units, $d$ be the discount rate (tasa de descuento) as a ratio, then
> $$D = d \cdot P_i\\
> P = P_i - D = P_i - d \cdot P_i$$

The discount rate $d$ is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit of the price that becomes discounted.

(Margen de ganancia)
**Mark-up**: retailers buy goods at a wholesale price (precio mayorista), and then resell said goods at a list price (precio de lista | precio sugerido). Their profit comes from the mark-up which is the extra price added to the wholesale price to obtain the list price.

> Basic mark-up formula
>
> Let $W$ be the wholesale price of a good in monetary units, $M$ be the amount of mark-up in monetary units, $L$ be the list price in monetary units, and $m$ be the mark-up rate as a ratio, then
> $$M = m \cdot W\\
> L = W + M = W + m \cdot W$$

The mark-up rate is commonly expressed as a percent, which means the percent of each monetary unit of the wholesale price that becomes mark-up.

## Simple interest (Interés simple)
[Ch06_S04](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=568)

(Principal de una inversión)
**Investment principal**: the amount of money put into an investment.

(Principal de un préstamo)
**Loan principal**: the amount of money borrowed as a loan.

(Interés financiero)
**Financial interest**: money received in return for an investment, or paid for a loan.

(Interés simple)
**Simple interest**: a way to calculate the amount of interest to be received for an investment or paid for a loan.

> Simple interest formula
>
> Let $P$ be the principal of the investment or loan in monetary units, $I$ be the amount of interest in monetary units, $t$ be the time elapsed since the moment of the investment or loan in time units, and $r$ be the interest rate (tasa de interés) paid per period as a ratio, then
> $$I = Prt$$

## Proportions (Proporciones)
[Ch06_S05](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=578)

(Proporción)
**Proportion**: an equation in which two fractions (ratios or rates) are equated

> Proportion
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, be numbers, with $b$ and $d$ being nonzero, then
> $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
> $$ This is a proportion, it's read as $a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$ ($a$ es a $b$ como $c$ es a $d$).

(Producto cruzado)
**Cross product**: a proportion where the denominators have been multiplied in both sides, i.e. in the proportion $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, the cross product is $a \cdot d = c \cdot b$. This concept is used to test if a proportion is true without dividing.

(Proporción con porcentajes)
**Percent proportion**: a proportion in which one of the fractions is a percentage. Using terms from before, let $B$ be the base, $A$ the amount, then $\frac{A}{B} = \frac{p}{100}$, this means that the amount $A$ is to the base $B$ as $p$ is to $100$.
