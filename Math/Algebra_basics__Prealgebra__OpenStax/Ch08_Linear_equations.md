## Solve equations using the subtraction and addition properties of equality (Solucionar ecuaciones usando las propiedades sustractiva y aditiva de la igualdad)
[Ch08_S01](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=671)

Solving an equation commonly means isolating a variable to find its value.

The subtraction property of equality is used to solve equations when there is a positive term added to the variable, then said term is subtracted from both sides of the equality, helping in isolating the variable.

The addition property of equality is used to solve equations when there is a negative term which subtracts from the variable, then said term is added to both sides of the equality, helping in isolating the variable.

[Ch08_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=685)

The division property of equality is used to solve equations when there is a factor multiplying the variable, then both sides of the equality are divided by said factor, helping in isolating the variable.

The multiplication property of equality is used to solve equations when there is a number dividing the variable, then said number is multiplied to both sided of the equality, helping in isolating the variable.

Linear equations can start with variable terms on both sides. When equations have variables and constants on both sides, the properties of equality can be used to move the variables and put them in one side if needed. For example, if a variable is dividing a number, it can be passed to the other side by using the multiplication property of equality, multiplying both sides by the variable.

(Lado para variables de una ecuación)
**Variable side of an equation**: A side of an equation that can be arbitrarily chosen to hold variables, or a single variable, in order to isolate it and find its value.

(Lado para constantes de una ecuación)
**Constant side of an equation**: The other side of an equation that is produced when choosing a variable side.

(Ecuación lineal)
**Linear equation**: an equation in which the variables have an exponent of $1$.

(Ecuación lineal en una variable)
**Linear equation in one variable**: linear equation in which there is only one variable. These equations can be simplified by using the properties of equality to create a variable side and a constant side.

> Let $a$, $b$, be numbers, $x$ be a variable, then
> $$ a \cdot x = b$$

Every linear equation in one variable can be simplified through the use of the properties of equality, to leave it in the form $a \cdot x = b$. The side $a \cdot x$ is the variable side, and the side $b$ is the constant side.

(Combinar términos variables)
**Collect variable terms**: the process of combining the like terms of a variable in one side, this creates the variable side of the equation.

(Combinar términos constantes)
**Collect constant terms**: the process of combining like terms without variables, this creates the constant side of the equation.

## Solve equations with fraction or decimal coefficients (Solucionar ecuaciones con coeficientes fraccionales o decimales)
[Ch08_S04](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=711)

Equations with fractions and decimals behave ultimately the same as regular equations.

**Clear an equation of fractions**: the process of clearing the fractions of an equation, by multiplying each term by the least common denominator.
