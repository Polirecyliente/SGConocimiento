## Definitions of decimals (Definiciones de decimales)
[Ch05_S01](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=415)

(Decimales)
**Decimals**: the numeric representation of fractions in the place value system. Proper fractions have a value less than 1, to express them as decimals, the places to the right of the units place are used. The separation between the units place and the decimal places is commonly shown with a dot. For example, the numbers 0.1, 3.541, etc.

About their place value, the first place to the right has its value multiplied by 10 to the -1, the second place has its value multiplied by 10 to the -2, the third place to the -3, and so on.

(Decimales equivalentes)
**Equivalent decimals**: different decimal numbers that have the same value. For example $10.3$ has the same value as $10.30$, or $10.300$.

(Conversión entre decimales y fracciones)
**Conversion between decimals and fractions**: decimals can be presented in fraction form, and vice versa.

## Decimal operations (Operaciones con decimales)
[Ch05_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=434)

(Adición y sustracción de decimales)
**Addition and subtraction of decimals**: like regular addition and subtraction. When using decimals, the decimal places are added or subtracted correspondingly.

(Multiplicación y división de decimales)
**Multiplication and division of decimals**: like regular multiplication and division. When doing division, an infinite amount of decimals can appear. When doing multiplication, the amount of decimals is up to the sum of the decimals in the factors.

(Multiplicación y división por 10)
**Multiplication and division by 10**: given that 10 is the base of the decimal place value system, multiplying a number by 10 moves the number one digit to the left, while dividing a number by 10 moves the number one digit to the right. For example, $2 \cdot 10 = 20$, and $2 \div 10 = 0.2$.

## Decimals and fractions (Decimales y fracciones)

(Decimales periódicos)
**Repeating decimals**: a decimal in which a group of digits repeats itselft continuously. They can be expressed as fractions and vice versa.
[Repeating decimals code](Programs/Ch05/S03_01_Repeating_decimals.py)

Repeating decimals are denoted with a horizontal bar over the digits that repeat. For example, in $\frac{8}{7} = 1.\overline{142857}$, the line over $142857$ indicates that it repeats itself infinitely many times.

(Círculo)
**Circle**: shape in which all of its points are at the same distance from its center.

(Radio de un círculo)
**Radius of a circle**: the distance from the center of a circle to any of its points.

(Diámetro de un círculo)
**Diameter of a circle**: the maximum possible distance between two points in a circle. This is the same as twice the radius.

(Circunferencia de un círculo)
**Circumference of a circle**: the measure of the distance around a circle, i.e. the distance covered by its points.

(La constante pi)
**The pi constant**: the fraction of the circumference over the diameter. It's represented with the greek letter pi, which is $\pi$. The value of pi is roughly $\pi = 3.14159...$, this is a non repeating decimal.

(Fórmula de la circunferencia)
**Circumference formula**: let $d$ be the diameter, $r$ be the radius, $C$ be the circumference, then by definition $\pi = \frac{C}{d}$, and $d = 2 \cdot r$, so $C = \pi \cdot d = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot r$.

(Sector circular)
**Circular sector**: a portion of a circle. A sector is originated from the intersection of two radii segments and the circumference.

(Fórmula del área de un círculo)
**Circle area formula**: let $A$ be the area of a circle, $r$ be the radius, $C$ be the circumference, then $A = \pi \cdot r^2$. This is because when dividing the circle in many small sectors, and then lining the circumference to make a straight line, the result is half a rectangle of sides $C$ and $r$, so $A = \frac{C \cdot r}{2} = \frac{2 \cdot \pi \cdot r \cdot r}{2} = \pi \cdot r^2$.

(Aproximación fraccionaria de pi)
**Fractional approximation of pi**: there are infinitely many fractional approximations of pi, one of the simplest is $\frac{22}{7}$.

## Solution of an equation with decimals (Solución de una ecuación con decimales)
[Ch05_S04](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=467)

An equation with decimals can have a decimal solution, just like a regular solution.

## Averages, probability (Promedios, probabilidad)
[Ch05_S05](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=476)

(Promedios)
**Averages**: measures of the typical number in a set of numbers. A typical number is that which is most likely to appear from the set, or one that has a value in the middle of the values of the set. The measure of an average itself doesn't have to be part of the set of numbers, so a number that is not in the set, could be a representative value for said set.
