(Variables)
**Variables**: the representation of quantities that can vary, written using letters of the alphabet, such as $a, b, c, x, y, z$

(Funciones)
**Functions**: an operation or set of operations done over a number or numbers, that returns a result. Operators act as functions, $a + b$ can be written as $sum(a,b)$, where the function $sum$ returns the sum of $a, b$.

(Símbolos algebraicos)
**Algebraic symbols**: operators, functions, variables, numbers.

(Operadores relacionales)
**Relational operators**: operators that compare the values of two quantities.

(Igualdad)
**Equality**: when the values of two quantities are equal, $a = b$ means the value of $a$ is equal to the value of $b$.

(Desigualdad)
**Inequality**: when the values of two quantities are not equal, or may not be equal.

(Mayor que)
**Greater than**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is greater than the second. The operator is $>$, the greater than sign. $a > b$, read as $a$ greater than $b$ ($a$ mayor que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is greater than the value of $b$.

(Menor que)
**Less than**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is less than the second. The operator is $<$, the less than sign. $a < b$, read as $a$ less than $b$ ($a$ menor que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is less than the value of $b$.

(Mayor o igual que)
**Greater than or equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is greater than or equal to the second. The operator is $\ge$, the greater than or equal to sign. $a \ge b$, read as $a$ greater than or equal to $b$ ($a$ mayor o igual que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is greater than or equal to the value of $b$.

(Menor o igual que)
**Less than or equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where the first is less than or equal to the second. The operator is $\le$, the less than or equal to sign. $a \le b$, read as $a$ less than or equal to $b$ ($a$ menor o igual que $b$), means that the value of $a$ is less than or equal to the value of $b$.

(Diferente a)
**not equal to**: the comparison of two numbers where they have different values. The operator is $\ne$, the not equal to sign. $a \ne b$, read as $a$ not equal to $b$ ($a$ diferente a $b$), means that the value of $a$ is not equal to the value of $b$.

(Orden de las operaciones)
**Order of operations**: The order in which to execute the operations. In $5 + 10/2$, the result is $10$ if division is done first, but the result is $7.5$ if addition is done first.

(Signos de agrupación)
**Grouping symbols**: symbols that act as operators by grouping algebraic symbols. The grouped symbols are operated together. The grouping symbols serve to make explicit the order of operations.

(Paréntesis)
**Parentheses**: this operator is $()$, the parentheses signs. $8(14 - 8)$ returns $48$.

(Corchetes)
**Brackets**: this operator is $[]$, the brackets signs. $21 - 3[2 + 4(9 - 8)]$ returns $3$

(Llaves)
**Braces**: this operator is $\{\}$, the braces signs. $24 \div \{13 - 2[(6 - 5) + 4]\}$ returns $8$

(Expresiones y ecuaciones)
**Expressions and equations**: two expressions can form an equation by connecting them with an equal sign, $a + b = c/d$.

(Simplificación)
**Simplification**: do all possible operations in an expression. $4 \cdot 2 + 1$ can be simplified to $9$

(Notación exponencial)
**Exponential notation**: used in expressions where a number is multiplied by itself several times, $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$ is written as $2^4$, $a \cdot a \cdot a \ldots$
