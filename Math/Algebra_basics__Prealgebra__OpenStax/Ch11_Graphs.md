## Rectangular coordinate system (Sistema de coordenadas rectangulares)
[Ch11_S01](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=961)

The rectangular coordinate system is the 2D version of the number line, it is made with a horizontal number line and a vertical number line that cross each other at zero. The positive numbers in the horizontal number line are at the right of zero, and the positive numbers in the vertical number are above zero.

The horizontal number line is called the x-axis (el eje x) or abscissa axis (eje de abscisas). The vertical number line is called the y-axis (el eje y) or ordinate axis (eje de ordenadas).

The rectangular coordinate system is also called the x-y plane (el plano x-y), the coordinate plane (el plano coordenado), or the Cartesian coordinate system (el plano cartesiano)

The rectangular coordinate system forms a grid in which there is a vertical line that passes through each number in the x-axis, and there is an horizontal line that passes through each number in the y-axis.

Each of the four divisions of the x-y plane is called a quadrant, they are denoted with roman numerals, 'I', 'II', 'III', and 'IV', as shown in the image.

(Par ordenado)
**Ordered pair**: a pair of numbers that can be used to represent a point in the rectangular coordinate system. Just as in the number line a single number is required to know the location of a point, in the x-y plane two numbers are required, which should be ordered to know which number goes in the x-axis and which in the y-axis. By convention, the first number in an ordered pair indicates the value in the x-axis, and the second number indicates the value in the y-axis.

> Ordered pair notation
>
> Let $a$, $b$ be two numbers, then the ordered pair made with them is
> $$(a, b)$$

$a$ is the x-axis value, and $b$ is the y-axis value.

(Punto en el eje)
**Points on the axes**: any point that lies in an axis, i.e. a point whose ordered pair contains at least a zero. A point $(a, 0)$ is in the x-axis, and a point $(0, b)$ is in the y-axis.

(El origen)
**The origin**: the point in which both axes cross each other, i.e. the point $(0, 0)$.

(Gráfica)
**Graph**: the use of the x-y plain to show points. These points can come from a mathematical function or equation, points scattered, etcetera. If the graph comes from an equation, it is read as the graph of the equation (la gráfica de la ecuación).

(Ecuación en dos variables)
**Equation in two variables**: an equation that has two variables. Setting the value of one of the variables allows finding the value of the other.

(Ecuación lineal en dos variables)
**Linear equation in two variables**: linear equation with two variables, such that a change in one of the variables produces a proportional change in the other variable.

> Standard form of a linear equation in two variables
>
> Let $A$, $B$, $C$, be constants, $x$, $y$, be variables, then
> $$Ax + By = C$$
> This is a linear equation, its solutions form a line whem shown in a graph of the x-y plain.

The amount of solutions of a linear equation is infinite, the line formed by the equation can be extended indefinitely.

## Graphs of linear equations (Gráficas de ecuaciones lineales)
[Ch11_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=984)

The graph of a given linear equation shows the solutions of the given linear equation, because the graph is constructed from a few solutions of the equation, and then by extending the line in the graph.

A polynomial can be graphed similarly

(Graficar puntos)
**Point plotting method**: individual points from an equation can be plotted, e.g. in a linear equation, individual points can be plotted and then a single line can be passed through them to form the graph of the equation. This method starts by plotting points of a given equation and then joining them with a line or lines as necessary.

(Gráfica de líneas horizontales y verticales)
**Graph of horizontal and vertical lines**: in the x-y plane, the equation $x = a$ represents a vertical line that passes through the point $(a, 0)$, and the equation $y = b$ represents an horizontal line that passes through the point $(0, b)$.
