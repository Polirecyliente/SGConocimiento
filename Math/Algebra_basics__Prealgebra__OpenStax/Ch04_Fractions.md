## Visualizing fractions (Visualizando fracciones)

(Fracciones)
**Fractions**: numbers that represent a part of a whole number or an integer, so there are many fractions between any two integers. This set of numbers also forms an ordered set in which the relational operators can be used to compare the values of two fractions.

(Notación de las fracciones)
**Fraction notation**: given that fractions are numbers that can be between two integers, they are represented with a division, a fraction that is not integer has a remainder different from 0 when represented as a division. The fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is calculated as $a$ divided by $b$, with $b \ne 0$.

For example, $\frac{2}{3}$ means $2$ divided by $3$, and using the definition of division, this calculates the amount of times that the number $3$ is subtracted from $2$ until 0 is reached, but subtracting $3$ from $2$ gives $-1$ because $2 - 3 = -1$, so to reach 0, a proportion, fraction, or part of $3$ must be subtracted from $2$, and not the full unity of the number $3$. 

By the definition of division, $\frac{2}{3}$ is the amount of times that $3$ is subtracted from $2$ to reach 0. This amount, $\frac{2}{3}$ is between $0$ and $1$ and it occupies the same proportional distance to $1$, as the number $2$ occupies to $3$.

(Numerador y denominador)
**Numerator and denominator**: the numbers in a fraction, the numerator is the number on top (called dividend in the division operation), and the denominator is the number at the bottom (called divisor in the division operation). For example, in $\frac{a}{b}$ $a$ is the numerator and $b$ is the denominator.
