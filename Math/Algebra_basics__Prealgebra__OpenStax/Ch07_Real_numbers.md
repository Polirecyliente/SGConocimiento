## Rational and irrational numbers (Números racionales e irracionales)

(Números racionales)
**Rational numbers**: the set of numbers that can be represented via fractions. This is an ordered set in which the relational operators can be used to compare the values of two rational numbers.

Rational numbers when represented as decimals, have their decimal part with a finite amount of digits, or if the amount is infinite then it repeats itself.

(Números irracionales)
**Irrational numbers**: the set of numbers such as $\pi$, in which the decimal part of the number is infinite and never repeats itself.

The square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is also irrational.

The fact that they are called irrational, doesn't necessarily mean that they can't have predictable patterns, for example, a number such as $0.101001000100001000001...$ is irrational by definition, but it can be understood as the number with a $1$ in between a steady growing number of $0$s. This pattern is infinite and never repeats itself, so it's an irrational number.

(Números reales)
**Real numbers**: the union of the sets of rational and irrational numbers.

## Commutative properties, associative properties (Propiedades conmutativas, propiedades asociativas)
[Ch07_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=611)

(Propiedad conmutativa de la adición)
**Commutative property of addition**: the order of the addends doesn't change the sum, $a + b = b + a$. Given that addition means movement after the first number in the direction of the second, this means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the end result is the same.

Subtraction is not commutative. If $a \ne b$, then $a - b \ne b - a$.

(Propiedad conmutativa de la multiplicación)
**Commutative property of multiplication**: the order of the factors doesn't change the product, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$. Given that multiplication means the repeated addition of the first number with itself a number of times equal to the second number, this means that no matter which number comes first and which second, the final repeated addition is the same.

Division is not commutative. If $a \ne b$, then $\frac{a}{b} \ne \frac{b}{a}$.

(Propiedad asociativa de la adición)
**Associative property of addition**: using grouping symbols to group addition operations does not change the sum, $a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.

(Propiedad asociativa de la multiplicación)
**Associative property of multiplication**: using grouping symbols to group multiplication operations does not change the product, $a \cdot b \cdot c = (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
