## Rational and irrational numbers (Números racionales e irracionales)
[Ch07_S01](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=603)

(Números racionales)
**Rational numbers**: the set of numbers that can be represented via fractions. This is an ordered set in which the relational operators can be used to compare the values of two rational numbers.

Rational numbers when represented as decimals, have their decimal part with a finite amount of digits, or if the amount is infinite then it repeats itself, which means that a decimal number that is rational can always be represented as a fraction.

(Números irracionales)
**Irrational numbers**: the set of numbers such as $\pi$, in which the decimal part of the number is infinite and never repeats itself. The square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is also irrational.

The fact that they are called irrational, doesn't necessarily mean that they can't have predictable patterns, for example, a number such as $0.101001000100001000001...$ is irrational by definition, but it can be understood as the number with a $1$ in between a steady growing number of $0$s. This pattern is infinite and never repeats itself, so it's an irrational number.

(Números reales)
**Real numbers**: the union of the sets of rational and irrational numbers.

## Associative properties (Propiedades asociativas)
[Ch07_S02](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=611)

See Ch01_Whole_numbers.md for the commutative properties of addition and multiplication.

(Propiedad asociativa de la adición)
**Associative property of addition**: using grouping symbols to group addition operations does not change the sum.

> Associative property of addition
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be numbers, then
> $$a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$

(Propiedad asociativa de la multiplicación)
**Associative property of multiplication**: using grouping symbols to group multiplication operations does not change the product.

> Associative property of multiplication
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be numbers, then
> $$a b c = (a b) c = a (b c)$$

## Distributive property (Propiedad distributiva)
[Ch07_S03](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=623)

(Propiedad distributiva de la multiplicación respecto a la suma)
**Distributive property of multiplication over addition**: when a group of addends (grouped using a grouping symbol) is multiplied by a number, it's the same as the sum of the products of said number by each addend.

> Distributive property
>
> Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be numbers, then
> $$a (b + c) = a b + a c$$

This property shows itself when multiplying $a$ by the sum $b + c$, the resulting product can be seen as the sum of $a b$ and $a c$. This property actually includes subtraction as a case of the sum, given that the addends can be negative numbers.

## Inverse properties, zero properties (Propiedades inversas, propiedades del cero)
[Ch07_S04](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=635)

(Inverso aditivo)
**Additive inverse**: the opposite of a number, is its additive inverse. The additive inverse of a number $a$ is $-a$.

(Propiedad inversa aditiva)
**Inverse property of addition**: the sum of a number and its additive inverse is zero.

> Inverse property of addition
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a + (-a) = a - a = 0$$

$0$ is the additive identity. (see Ch01_Whole_numbers.md)

(Inverso multiplicativo)
**Multiplicative inverse**: the reciprocal of a number, is its multiplicative inverse. The multiplicative inverse of a number $a$ is $\frac{1}{a}$.

(Propiedad inversa de la multiplicación)
**Inverse property of multiplication**: the product of a number and its multiplicative inverse is one.

> Inverse property of multiplication
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \frac{1}{a} = 1$$

$1$ is the multiplicative identity. (see Ch01_Whole_numbers.md)

(Multiplicación por 0)
**Multiplication by 0**: the product of any number and 0 is 0.

> Multiply a number by 0
>
> Let $a$ be a number, then
> $$a \cdot 0 = 0$$

This is because $a$ is added $0$ times with itself.

See Ch01_Whole_numbers.md for the properties of 0 in the division operation.

## Systems of measurement (Sistemas de medida)
[Ch07_S05](../../../Libros/Mathematics/Algebra_basics__Prealgebra__OpenStax.pdf#page=646)

The systems of measurement are systems intended to be internally consistent, to provide a unit of measure for any physical quantity. The main quantities measured in these systems are time and space (time, distance, area, volume, see Ch09_Math_models_Geometry.md), derived quantities are also included like speed (distance divided by time), and also units of measure for other quantities, like electric field, radiation levels, etcetera.

There are two main systems of measurement used at the time of this writing, the U.S. system and the international metric system.

(Conversión de unidades)
**Unit conversion**: changing the units of a measure. Unit conversion is based on multiplying the unit to be changed by $1$, but writing $1$ in such a way that it changes the unit of measure. In general, given the units of measure $unit1$ and $unit2$, and given $A\ unit1 = B\ unit2$ meaning that $A$ units of $unit1$ are equal in measure to $B$ units of $unit2$, so $1 = \frac{B\ unit2}{A\ unit1}$, and also $1 = \frac{A\ unit1}{B\ unit2}$. These fractions are called conversion factors (factores de conversión).

Using real units, $1\ foot = 12\ inches$, so $1 = \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches}$, and $1 = \frac{12\ inches}{1\ foot}$. The fraction chosen to do the unit conversion is the one that divides the unit being changed, so, the one that has the unit being changed in the denominator. For example, to convert $60\ inches$ to $feet$, the conversion factor must have $inches$ in the denominator, $60\ inches \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} = 5 feet$.

Several conversions can be made one after the other, for example, $60\ inches \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} \frac{1\ yard}{3\ feet} = \frac{5}{3}\ yard$.

(Conversión entre sistemas de medida)
**Conversion between systems of measurement**: units of measure can be converted from one system to another by having their equivalencies (equivalencias), and then performing regular unit conversion using said equivalencies.

The following table contains a few of the equivalencies between units in the U.S. customary units system and units in the international metric system. The values presented in the table are approximations.

| Equivalencies   |
| :------------:  |
| **Length**      |
| 1 in = 2.54 cm  |
| 1 ft = 0.305 m  |
| 1 yd = 0.914 m  |
| 1 mi = 1.61 km  |
| **Weight**      |
| 1 lb = 0.45 kg  |
| 1 oz = 28 g     |
| **Volume**      |
| 1 qt = 0.95 L   |
| 1 fl oz = 30 mL |

(Unidades de medida mixtas)
**Mixed units of measurement**: units of measure that are combined together to measure a single quantity. For example, using hours and minutes together to measure time.

When handling mixed units of measurement, each separate unit is added or subtracted separately. In the case of using hours and minutes together, for example $3\ hours, 12\ minutes$ plus $2\ hours, 20\ minutes$ is $5\ hours, 32\ minutes$, because hours and minutes are added separately. In this particular case, any amount of minutes over 60 is converted to hours accordingly, and in general the smaller unit is converted to the bigger unit if needed.

(Conversión Fahrenheit Celsius)
**Fahrenheit Celsius conversion**: two formulas that allow converting temperature (temperatura) measured in the Fahrenheit scale to the Celsius scale, and vice versa.

> Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formula
>
> Let $C$ be the temperature in Celsius, $F$ be the temperature in Fahrenheit, then
> $$C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$

> Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion formula
>
> Let $C$ be the temperature in Celsius, $F$ be the temperature in Fahrenheit, then
> $$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$
