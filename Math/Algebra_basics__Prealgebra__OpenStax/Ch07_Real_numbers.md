(Números racionales)
**Rational numbers**: the set of numbers that can be represented via fractions. This is an ordered set in which the relational operators can be used to compare the values of two rational numbers.

Rational numbers when represented as decimals, have their decimal part with a finite amount of digits, or if the amount is infinite then it repeats itself.

(Números irracionales)
**Irrational numbers**: the set of numbers such as $\pi$, in which the decimal part of the number is infinite and never repeats itself.

The square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is also irrational.

The fact that they are called irrational, doesn't necessarily mean that they can't have predictable patterns, for example, a number such as $0.101001000100001000001...$ is irrational by definition, but it can be understood as the number with a $1$ in between a steady growing number of $0$s. This pattern is infinite and never repeats itself, so it's an irrational number.

(Números reales)
**Real numbers**: the union of the sets of rational and irrational numbers.
