(Razonamiento inductivo)
**Inductive reasoning**: inductive reasoning means reasoning on the basis of observed patterns.

(Patrones numÃ©ricos)
**Number patterns**: patterns made with numbers. Discovering the pattern requires inductive reasoning.

> Example of a number pattern
>
> The numbers $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$... form a pattern, in this pattern, the next numbers are most likely $10$, $12$, $14$, etcetera.

A number pattern may be represented as an equation in two variables, one variable for the position or term in the pattern (first, second, third, etcetera), and one variable for the value of the pattern in that position or term.

> Example of the equation of a number pattern
>
> Let the pattern be $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$..., let $n$ be the term of the pattern, and let $P_n$ be the value of the pattern in the term $n$, then
> $$P_n = 2n$$

(Conjetura)
**Conjecture**: an unproven explanation of a pattern.

> Example of a conjecture
>
> In the pattern $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$... the conjecture is that the value of the next term is $10$, and that the equation of this pattern is $P_n = 2n$ where $n$ is the term and $P_n$ is the pattern value of the term $n$. But it can happen that the value of the next term is not $10$ but another value, for example it could be $15$.

(Contraejemplo)
**Counterexample**: in a pattern, a counterexample is a pattern value that disproves a given conjecture.

> Example of a counterexample
>
> In the pattern $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$..., if the conjecture is that the pattern value of the next term is $10$, then a counterexample would be that the pattern value of the next term was actually $15$, this disproves the conjecture.

(Razonamiento deductivo)
**Deductive reasoning**: deductive reasoning means reasoning on the basis of given facts.

> Example of deductive reasoning
>
> Let $p$, $q$ be two events, such that $p \to q$. Given the fact that $p$ happens, the conclusion is that $q$ happens or will happen. Concluding that $q$ happens is a deduction, because it's a conclusion that was arrived to by reasoning on the basis of the given facts $p$ and $p \to q$.
