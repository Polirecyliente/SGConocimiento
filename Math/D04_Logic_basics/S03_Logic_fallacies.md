(Falacia lógica)
**Logic fallacy**: a set of logical statements that are wrong or misconstrued.

(Falacia del converso)
**Fallacy of the converse**: also known as affirming the consequent (afirmación del consecuente), this fallacy states that given two true facts, a conditional statement and the consequent of said conditional, then the antecedent is deduced as being true.

> Fallacy of the converse
>
> Let $p$, $q$ be two events, then
>
> $$\begin{gathered}
> p \to q\\
> q\\
> \therefore p
> \end{gathered}$$
> These logical statements are wrong, because if $p \to q$ is true and $q$ is true, then $p$ may or may not be true. It could be the case that $\neg p \to q$.

The fallacy of the converse is also known as the converse error (error converso), because it would only be true if the converse $q \to p$ was true, instead of the actual conditional $p \to q$.
