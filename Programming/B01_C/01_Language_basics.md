# INTRODUCTION

This document is about the C programming language and its features.

The C language is a compiled language, which means that a compiler is needed to convert C source code into binary code.

The concepts used here are defined in [Programming definitions](../01_Programming_definitions.md).

# BASIC USAGE

Source code files of the C language have the file extension `.c` and they are written in a plain text format.

This project uses the `gcc` compiler to compile C source code files into binary code files. GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection. GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix, GNU is a free and open source software project.

Compile a C source code file `/path/to/file1.c` into a binary code file `/path/to/bin1`, by using the following command in a shell.

``` {.bash .syntax}
gcc /path/to/file1.c -o /path/to/bin1
```

To execute the binary code file, use the following command in a shell.

``` {.bash .syntax}
/path/to/bin1
```

# BASIC SYNTAX

Every program created with the C language must have one and only one function called `main`, the `main` function is the entry point where the execution of the program starts.

The `main` function returns an integer value, the value $0$ means that the program was executed successfully. Any value different from $0$ indicates that the program exits because of an error.

The syntax of the `main` function is as follows:

``` {.C .syntax}
int main()
{
	statements1;
	return 0;
}
```

`int` and `return` are keywords, they are explained in this document.


----

`statements1` represents the statements of the code. The smallest possible C program that does nothing is produced by deleting the `statements1` line.

Statements in C must be terminated with a semicolon, `statement1;`.

Blocks of code in C are enclosed in curly braces, `{ block_of_code1 }`.


----

C ignores whitespace and so it does not require indentation, so the following is a valid C program.

``` {.C .syntax}
int main() { statement1; return 0; }
```


----

Multiple statements can be written per line.

``` {.C .syntax}
statement1; statement2; statementN;
```


----

Multiline statements are written directly (names of variables and functions can't be broken into lines).

``` {.C .syntax}
state
ment1
;
```

For example:

``` C
int
main
()
{
	  statement1
	  ;
    return
    0
    ;
}
```


----

To use basic functionality, like read keyboard input from standard input, and printing character output to standard output, the `stdio.h` header is used. The `stdio.h` header is included with the `#include` directive. Headers and directives are explained in this document.

The following syntax shows a common way to write a file to test C source code.

``` {.C .syntax}
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	statements1;
	return 0;
}
```


----

To print characters to standard output, use the `printf` function. This function is included with the `stdio.h` header.

``` {.C .syntax}
printf("This text will be printed to standard output");
```

To print a given variable do:

``` {.C .syntax}
int var1 = value1;
printf("%d", var1);
```

`int var1 = value1` creates a variable `var1` of data type `int` (for integer) with a value of `value1`. `%d` is called a format specifier. Variables, data types, and format specifiers are explained in this document. This is placed here because it's the minimum required to use the `printf` function to print the value of an integer variable.

The following is a minimal complete program that prints to standard output.

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("string1");
  return 0;
}
```

Compiling and executing this program in a shell outputs:

``` output
string1
```

The following program prints an integer variable to standard output.

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int var1 = 5;
  printf("%d", var1);
  return 0;
}
```

Compiling and executing this program in a shell outputs:

``` output
5
```


----

To read data from standard input, use the `scanf` function.

``` {.C .syntax}
int a;
scanf("%d", &a);
```

The `&` in `&a` is the address operator, `&a` is the address of the variable `a`. The address operator, and the address of a variable are explained in this document. This is placed here because the `scanf` function requires the address of a variable and not the variable itself.

The following is a minimal complete program that reads from standard input.

``` C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}
```

Compiling and executing this program in a shell, prompts the user to enter characters with the keyboard. Use the `enter` key to finish inputting characters. In this program, the input expected is an integer number, for example '34', but inputting text does not throw an error, it is undefined behavior.

After inputting an integer number, this program prints that integer and exits. Inputting text makes the program print numbers that change. Even when inputting the same text, the printed output number varies because doing so is undefined behavior.

# DATA TYPES

C is a statically typed language, so to create a variable, the data type of the variable must be specified. In order to achieve this, the C language has keywords for the data types.


----

A variable is created by writing the keyword of its data type and then the name of the variable.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 var1;
```

`var1` is the name of the variable, and `data_type1` is a keyword of the data type of `var1`. This syntax is for the declaration of `var1`.


----

Several variables of the same data type can be declared in a single statement, separating the variables by comma.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 var1, var2, varN;
```


----

The equal sign '=' is used as an assignment operator to assign a value to a variable.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 var1 = value1;
```

`value1` must be of the same data type as `data_type1`, otherwise it's undefined behavior. This syntax is for the definition of `var1`.


----

Several variables of the same data type can be defined in a single statement, separating the variables by comma.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 var1 = value1, var2 = value2, varN = valueN;
```


----

Declarations and definitions in a single statement can be mixed.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 var1, var2 = value2;
```


----

`var1` can be declared on one statement, and defined on another statement.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 var1;
var1 = value1;
```


----

The `void` keyword represents the lack of data type, it's used in functions and in type casting.

## Numeric data types

The `int` keyword is used to create variables of integer data type.

``` {.C .syntax}
int var1 = num1;
```

For example:

``` C
int var1 = 5;
```


----

Hexadecimal integers can be written by prefixing the number with `0x`, for example the hexadecimal number '5A' would be written as `0x5A`.

``` C
int var1 = 0x5A;
```


----

Octal integers can be written by prefixing the number with `0`, for example the octal number '11' would be written as `011`.

``` C
int var1 = 011;
```


----

Binary integers can be written by prefixing the number with `0b`, for example the binary number '10100' woud be written as `0b10100`.

``` C
int var1 = 0b10100;
```


----

Integers can be signed or unsigned. By default, integers are signed.

``` C
int var1 = -20000;
```


----

The `unsigned` keyword makes the number unsigned.

``` C
unsigned int var1 = 50000
```


----

The `signed` keyword makes the number signed.

``` C
signed int var1 = -20000
```

### Suffixes for numeric data types

Numbers can have suffixes.

There are suffixes that act as keywords, for example the `u` or `U` suffix is used to make an unsigned number.

``` {.C .syntax}
int var1 = num1u;
int var2 = num1U;
```

For example:

``` C
int var1 = 50000u;
```

This makes `var1` an unsigned integer variable.


----

The `p` or `P` suffix is used to multiply a hexadecimal number by a power of 2. This suffix is necessary to create floating hexadecimals.

``` {.C .syntax}
float var1 = num1pint1;
float var2 = num2Pint2;
```

`int1` and `int2` can be positive or negative integers.

For example:

``` C
float var1 = 0x5.1p0;
```

Printing `var1` outputs:

``` output
5.062500
```

An example with an exponent different from 0:

``` C
float var1 = 0x5.1p4;
```

Printing `var1` outputs:

``` output
81.000000
```

The decimal number 81 is equivalent to the hexadecimal 0x51.

## String data types

In C the basic string data type is the character data type.

The `char` keyword is used to create variables of character data type.

``` {.C .syntax}
char var1 = 'char1';
```

Note that `'char1'` must be enclosed in single quotes. Single quotes are used to enclose single characters.

For example:

``` C
char var1 = 'n';
```


----

The `char` data type is an integer, so integers can be used to create characters, for example:

``` C
char var1 = 65;
```

Printing `var1` as a character outputs:

``` output
A
```


----

Not any arbitrary character can be created with the `char` data type, only the first 127 ASCII characters.

``` C
char var1 = 128;
```

Printing `var1` as a character outputs:

``` output
ï¿½
```


----

A `char` data type can be made unsigned, so that it holds values as big as 255, but this does not mean that up to 255 characters are supported, only the same first 127 ASCII characters are supported with the `unsigned char` data type.


----

A string is created with a pointer to a character. Pointers are explained in this document.

``` {.C .syntax}
char *var1 = "string1";
```

The asterisk '*' means that `*var1` is a pointer to a character. Note that `"string1"` must be enclosed in double quotes. Double quotes are used to enclose strings.

### Escaped characters and escape sequences

Characters and strings may be composed of escaped characters and escape sequences.
In the following tables, the output is the output of printing the variable in the example of the same table row.


----

: Escaped characters

   Escaped character            Example                 Output
  ------------------- ---------------------------- ----------------
        `'\\'`         `char *var1 = "A\\B";`{.C}   `A\B`{.output}


----

: Escape sequences

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
   Escape sequence            Example                   Output
  ----------------- ---------------------------- --------------------
        `\n`         `char *var1 = "A\nB";`{.C}     `A`{.output}\
                                                    `B`{.output}

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

## Constants

Constants can be created with the `const` keyword placed before the data type in a variable declaration or definition.

``` {.C .syntax}
const data_type1 CONSTANT1 = value1;
```

The name of constants is written in uppercase by convention. For example:

``` C
const int NUMBER = 8;
```

## Composite types

## Type casting

Type casting is done with the following syntax

``` {.C .syntax}
(data_type1) expression1;
```

`expression1` can be an expression or variable.

For example

``` C
int var1 = 5, var2 = 3;
double var3;
var3 = (double) var1/var2;
```

Printing `var3` outputs:

``` output
1.666667
```

Without the `(double)` type casting, printing `var3` outputs:

``` output
1.000000
```

Casting to `(double)` is necessary in this case to let the operation `var1/var2` result in a floating point number.

# OPERATORS

The addition operator is the plus sign `+`

``` {.C .syntax}
var1 = var2 + var3;
```

For example:

``` C
int var1, var2 = 5, var3 = 3;
var1 = var2 + var3;
```

Printing `var1` outputs:

``` output
8
```

# CONTROL FLOW

# FUNCTIONS

The `void` keyword can be used in functions. Using the `void` keyword as the data type of the return value of a function, means that the function returns nothing.

``` {.C .syntax}
void func1()
{
    statements1;
}
```

Note that `func1` has no return statement.


----

The `void` keyword is used to make a function take no arguments.

``` {.C .syntax}
data_type1 func1(void)
{
    statements1;
    return ret_val1;
}
```

For example:

``` C
int func1(void)
{
    return 5;
}
```


----

The `return` keyword must be followed by the return value of the function.

``` {.C .syntax}
return return_value1;
```

# PACKAGES

# HEADERS

# DIRECTIVES

The C language support directives, they are placed at the start of the file.

``` {.C .syntax}
#directive1

rest_of_file1
```


----

The `#define` directive is used to define macros. Macros are code that replaces other code, so macros can be used as variables, or as functions. By convention, macros are named using uppercase letters.


----

Macros can be created as variables

``` {.C .syntax}
#define MACRO1 value1
```

For example:

``` C
#define FIRST_NUMBER 6
```

This macro defines `FIRST_NUMBER` as a variable, but given that macros can't be changed in the code, `FIRST_NUMBER` is effectively a constant.


----

To create a macro as a variable, that holds a multiline string, use the following syntax.

``` {.C .syntax}
#define STRING1 "string starts"\
                " and continues"
```

Printing `STRING1` outputs:

``` output
string starts and continues
```


----

**Macro as a function**

``` {.C .syntax}
#define MACRO1(arg1, arg2) function_body1
```

For example:

``` C
#define F1(A, B) 2*A + B
```


----

The `#include` directive is used to include headers. Headers are files that declare or define variables, functions, and macros, so that they can be used in C source code. This is useful for example, to include functions defined in other files, so that it is not necessary to create those functions from scratch.

Headers are files that have the `.h` file extension, written in a plain text format. They are external files to the C source code files with the `.c` file extension.


----

Headers are searched for in a search path, because they are external files. The search path is a set of directories where the compiler searches for headers when they are included in a `.c` file being compiled.

A header that is in one of the directories in the search path, is included with the following syntax.

``` {.C .syntax}
#include <relative/path/to/header1.h>
```

`header1.h` is called a system header, because the search path is made of directories where the compiler expects the operating system to place headers to be used by any program that includes them.

The directory `relative/path/to/` is a subdirectory from one of the directories in the search path.

In case that `relative/path/to/header1.h` leads to two different `header1.h` files, the compiler will choose only one of them. To avoid this ambiguity, use the following syntax.

``` {.C .syntax}
#include </path/to/header1.h>
```

`/path/to/header1.h` is the full path of `header1.h`. This avoids ambiguity as to which header file is included.


----

Custom headers, that exist in the same directory or in a subdirectory of a `.c` file being compile, can be included with a different syntax.

``` {.C .syntax}
#include "relative/path/to/header1.h"
```

`relative/path/to/header1.h` is a relative path, relative to the `.c` file that includes `header1.h`.

This syntax of `"header1.h"` has precedence over the syntax for system headers `<header1.h>`, so writing `#include "header1.h"` includes the file `header1.h` in the same directory as the `.c` file that includes it, even if there is a system header called `header1.h`.

# STANDARD LIBRARY

## The `printf` function

The `printf` function deserves its own section in the standard library. This function is used as a basic interaction between the programmer and the programs being created by them in C. It is used as a basic debugging function, to print the value of a variable in the program, and check if the variable has an expected value or not.

After creating and debugging a program, the amount of calls to the `printf` function may be reduced, compared to the amount of calls during development. This depends on the type of program being made. A program that uses the GUI of the operating system, could need the `printf` function less than a program that uses the CLI of the operating system. In theory, a purely GUI program would never need to call the `printf` function, but in practice, most GUI programs can be started from the CLI, and GUI programs print to standard output about their execution.

It may happen that a program does not call `printf` directly, but rather calls a modified `printf` function.


----

The signature of the `printf` function is:

``` {.C .syntax}
printf("text %format1 text %formatN text", var1, varN);
```

Only the first argument is obligatory, the rest are optional arguments. There is one `%formatN` for each `varN`.


----

In the `printf` function signature, `%formatN` is the format specifier, it minimally consists of the percent sign and a single character that determines the expected data type format of its corresponding `varN`. The format specifier specifies the data type that `varN` must have. The format specifier is used to format `varN` according to its data type. A single data type can have a few different format specifiers to format said data type.

The format specifier can be modified, this is done with format modifiers. The following is the syntax for a format specifier that has format modifiers.

``` {.C .syntax}
%flag1width1.precision1length1specifier1
```

As can be seen, the format modifiers and the specifier at the end are written together with no spaces between them. All the modifiers are optional, the period goes with the `.precision1` modifier.


----

: Format specifiers

  ------------------------------------------------------------
   Format specifier           Example               Output
  ------------------ -------------------------- --------------
         `%d`           `int var1 = 5;`{.C}      `5`{.output}
                      `print("%d", var1);`{.C}

  ------------------------------------------------------------

In the format specifier `%d`, the 'd' stands for digit. It's used to format variables of data type `int` as regular digits.
