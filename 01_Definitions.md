# INTRODUCTION

This document contains the definitions needed to understand concepts that are general to all or some of the divisions in which this knowledge management system divides knowledge.

# BASIC CONCEPTS

::: term
**Thought**
  : A result of brain activity.
:::

::: term
**Idea**
  : A structured thought (structured by an intention).
:::

::: term
**Knowledge**
  : The set of ideas that are known.
:::

::: term
**System**
  : A set of parts that conform a whole. The parts may interact with each other. A system can be found in nature, or it can be designed. When a system is designed, it's done so that it fulfills a given set of purposes via the interactions between the elements of the system.
:::

The following diagram shows the structure of a system.

``` {.mermaid caption="Structure of a system" format="svg"}
graph TB
  subgraph System1
    Element1 <--> Element2 --> Element3 --> Element1
    Element3 <--> Element4
  end
```

The arrows represent the interactions between the elements of the system.

::: term
**Knowledge Management System**
  : A system to manage the knowledge of a person or a group of people.
\\\
  The idea of a knowledge management system, is to allow the people who use it, to organize their knowledge, to access it and use it more easily in the future, to share it with others, and to know what they know and what they don't know.
:::

::: term
**Arts**
  : The knowledge about techniques to create, something that is intended as an expression.
:::

::: term
**Computer science**
  : The knowledge about computing.
:::

::: term
**Human science**
  : The knowledge about humans and everything derived from them.
:::

::: term
**Math**
  : The knowledge about abstract concepts based on everything that can be done with numbers, patterns, structures, etcetera.
:::

::: term
**Natural science**
  : The knowledge about nature and its behavior.
:::

# GENERAL CONCEPTS

::: term
**Process**
  : A set of steps that take an input and result in an output.
:::

::: term
**Standard**
  : Rules and steps that are intended to do something. The idea of a standard, is that by following those rules and steps, the something that results from it, is always the same. This means that by following a standard, the result can be predicted.
\\\
  According to this definition, any process can be standardized, which means that each step of the process is always done in the same way (the way defined in the standard). The processes whose result is random, can have their randomness predicted and measured.
:::

::: term
**Specification**
  : A standard that has more specific requirements. For example, a standard could say that a variable must have its value between 'a' and 'b', and a specification could say that the variable must have the specific value 'c'.
