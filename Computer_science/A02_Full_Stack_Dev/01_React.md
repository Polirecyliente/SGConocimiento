# INTRODUCTION

React is a framework to create the frontend of web applications.

# BASIC USAGE

A new React application can be created with the following syntax.

``` bash
npx create-react-app application1
```

This creates a directory named `application1`.

The `npx` program can be installed with `sudo apt install npm`.


----

Inside the directory of a React application, the following command starts the application.

``` bash
npm start
```

By default the new React application can be accessed in the address `http://localhost:3000`. This address can be input in a browser like `firefox` or other.
