# SGConocimiento

SGConocimiento stands for 'Sistema de Gesti√≥n del Conocimiento' which is Spanish for 'Knowledge Management System'.

This project is my personal way to manage my knowledge, since I can't remember everything I learn at all times. It's written mainly in English, technical terms are translated to Spanish as well. Given that I'm the only person currently working on this project, excuse some of the cringy commit messages, if any.
