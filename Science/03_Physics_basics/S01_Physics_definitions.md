(Fórmula de la velocidad, distancia y tiempo)
**Velocity, distance and time formula**: velocity is defined as the rate of distance change over time.

> Velocity definition formula
>
> Let $d$ be the distance in length units, $t$ be the time in time units, $v$ be the velocity in distance over time units, then
> $$v = \frac{d}{t}$$

Solving this formula for $d$ gives $d = vt$, and solving it for $t$ gives $t = \frac{d}{v}$.

(Fórmula de tiempo en caída libre)
**Free fall time formula**: formula to find the fall time in a free fall scenario. The fall starts at a given height, and the time calculated by this formula is the time from the moment the fall starts, to the moment of reaching the ground.

> Free fall time formula
>
> Let $t$ be the fall time in time units, $h$ be the starting height in length units, $g$ be the standard gravity (gravedad estándar), then
> $$t = \sqrt{\frac{2 h}{g}}$$

The constant $g$ is measured as a rate, its units are length over squared time units. When using feet and seconds, $g = 32 ft/s^2$, and when using meters and seconds $g = 9.81 m/s^2$. Using $g = 32 ft/s^2$, then $t = \sqrt{\frac{2 h}{32}} = \sqrt{\frac{h}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{h}}{4}$, $h$ must be in feet, and $t$ is in seconds.

(Fórmula de la velocidad antes de frenar)
**Formula of the speed before braking**: formula to find the speed of a car before braking, from the length of the skid mark.

> Formula of the speed before braking
>
> Let $d$ be the skid mark distance in feet, $v$ be the speed of the car before braking in miles per hour, then
> $$v = \sqrt{24 d}$$
