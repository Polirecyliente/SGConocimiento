(Ratio)
**Ratio**: a fraction of any two numbers that are measured with the same unit or scale, therefore ratios have no units themselves. For example the ratio of height to width, both are measured in distance.

The notation of ratios in particular, includes the use of the colon : symbol to replace the division symbol. So the ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ can be denoted as $a:b$. If $b = 1$ then the ratio is still presented as $\frac{a}{1}$, and if the ratio is an improper fraction, it is not converted to a mixed number. The ratio $a:b$ is read as $a$ to $b$ ($a$ a $b$).

In a ratio, the division operation is not actually made, for example the ratio $a:b$, in this ratio, if $a$ and $b$ are measured in type1 units, the ratio indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units of type1. The division is not performed. This allows writing ratios with more than two numbers, for example the ratio $a:b:c$ with $c$ also measured in type1 units, indicates that there are $a$ units of type1 per every $b$ units, and also there are $a$ units per every $c$ units, and there are $b$ units per every $c$ units. When a ratio has more than two numbers, the fraction notation is not used, only the colon notation.

(Tasa)
**Rate**: a fraction of any two numbers that are measured in differente units or scales, so the unit of a rate is the fraction of the units. For example the rate of speed which is measured as a fraction of distance over time.

Ratios can be considered rates when the particular units in the numerator and denominator are also considered, even though they are the same. For example, width over height can be seen as a ratio, but also as the rate of width per unit of height, this rate is still dimensionless like a ratio.

(Tasa unitaria)
**Unit rate**: a rate expressed with a denominator of $1$.

(Precio unitario)
**Unit price**: a unit rate in which the unit is $\text{\textdollar}/unit$, it tells the price per unit.

(Porcentaje de aumento, porcentaje de disminución)
**Percent increase, percent decrease**: in general, the percent change (porcentaje de cambio) from a variable is measured as the difference of final value minus initial value, divided over the initial value, this result tells the amount of units changed per group of $1$ unit before change, and this can be converted to a percent.

> Percent change notation
>
> Let $V_i$ be the initial value of a given variable, $V_f$ be the final value of said variable, $\Delta p\%$ be the percent change, then
> $$\Delta p\% = \frac{V_f - V_i}{V_i} 100\%$$

Note that the words "initial" and "final" do not have to mean that they are separated in time, they can be separated under any criteria wanted.

Given that $V_f$ can be smaller or bigger than $V_i$, $\Delta p\%$ can be negative or positive, if it's negative then that means that the percent change is a percent decrease, whereas if it's positive then that means that the percent change is a percent increase.

(Notación científica)
**Scientific notation**: scientific notation is a way to express numbers. A given number written in scientific notation is represented as a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10, multiplied by a power of 10.

> Scientific notation
>
> Let $N$ be a number, $a$ be a number such that $a \ge 1$ and $a < 10$, and let $n$ be an integer, then
> $$N = a 10^n$$

To convert the given number $N$ to scientific notation, only its first nonzero digit is left as the first digit of $a$, and the remaining digits become decimals of $a$, this conversion is compensated as necessary using $n$, so that the equality $N = a 10^n$ is maintained. If $|N| \ge 1$ then $n$ must be zero or positive, while if $|N| < 1$ then $n$ must be negative. The sign of the number itself $N$ is not changed.

Any number $N$ can be expressed in scientific notation, for this let $a$ be a number such that $a \ge 1$ and $a < 10$, and let $n$ be an integer, then $N = a 10^n$. To convert the given number $N$ to scientific notation, only its first nonzero digit is left as the first digit of $a$, and the remaining digits become decimals of $a$, this conversion is compensated as necessary using $n$, so that the equality $N = a 10^n$ is maintained. If $|N| \ge 1$ then $n$ must be zero or positive, while if $|N| < 1$ then $n$ must be negative.

For example, the number $-3894.15509$ expressed in scientific notation is $-3.89415509 \cdot 10^3$, given that the decimal point was moved to the left (higher place values) the value of $n$ is positive $3$.

(Sistemas de medida)
**Systems of measurement**: the systems of measurement are systems intended to be internally consistent, to provide a unit of measure for any physical quantity. The main quantities measured in these systems are time and space (time, distance, area, volume), derived quantities are also included like speed (distance divided by time), and also units of measure for other quantities, like electric field, radiation levels, etcetera.

There are two main systems of measurement used at the time of this writing, the U.S. system and the international metric system.

(Conversión de unidades)
**Unit conversion**: changing the units of a measure. Unit conversion is based on multiplying the unit to be changed by $1$, but writing $1$ in such a way that it changes the unit of measure. In general, given the units of measure $unit1$ and $unit2$, and given $A\ unit1 = B\ unit2$ meaning that $A$ units of $unit1$ are equal in measure to $B$ units of $unit2$, so $1 = \frac{B\ unit2}{A\ unit1}$, and also $1 = \frac{A\ unit1}{B\ unit2}$. These fractions are called conversion factors (factores de conversión).

Using real units, $1\ foot = 12\ inches$, so $1 = \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches}$, and $1 = \frac{12\ inches}{1\ foot}$. The fraction chosen to do the unit conversion is the one that divides the unit being changed, so, the one that has the unit being changed in the denominator. For example, to convert $60\ inches$ to $feet$, the conversion factor must have $inches$ in the denominator, $60\ inches \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} = 5 feet$.

Several conversions can be made one after the other, for example, $60\ inches \frac{1\ foot}{12\ inches} \frac{1\ yard}{3\ feet} = \frac{5}{3}\ yard$.

(Conversión entre sistemas de medida)
**Conversion between systems of measurement**: units of measure can be converted from one system to another by having their equivalencies (equivalencias), and then performing regular unit conversion using said equivalencies.

The following table contains a few of the equivalencies between units in the U.S. customary units system and units in the international metric system. The values presented in the table are approximations.

| Equivalencies   |

| **Length**      |
| 1 in = 2.54 cm  |
| 1 ft = 0.305 m  |
| 1 yd = 0.914 m  |
| 1 mi = 1.61 km  |

| **Volume**      |
| 1 qt = 0.95 L   |
| 1 fl oz = 30 mL |

(Unidades de medida mixtas)
**Mixed units of measurement**: units of measure that are combined together to measure a single quantity. For example, using hours and minutes together to measure time.

When handling mixed units of measurement, each separate unit is added or subtracted separately. In the case of using hours and minutes together, for example $3\ hours, 12\ minutes$ plus $2\ hours, 20\ minutes$ is $5\ hours, 32\ minutes$, because hours and minutes are added separately. In this particular case, any amount of minutes over 60 is converted to hours accordingly, and in general the smaller unit is converted to the bigger unit if needed.

(Combinar unidades mixtas)
**Combine mixed units**: mixed units of measure can be combined together into a single unit. For example, time measured in minutes and seconds can be combined into minutes alone, by adding the seconds divided by $60$ to the minutes.

Money measured in different currency valued coins and bills can be combined together into a single currency value (a standard value), by converting the total of each type of coin and bill to said currency value and then adding them.

> Combine mixed units
>
> Let $I$ be the set of unique units to be mixed, let $i$ be a subindex of $I$, let $v_i$ be the standard value per unit $i$, $a_i$ be the amount of unit $i$, $V_i$ be the subtotal standard value of unit $i$, and let $V$ be the total standard value, then
>
> $$\begin{gathered}
> V_i = a_i v_i\\
> V = \sum_i{V_i}
> \end{gathered}$$

These formulas can be used to combine mixed units of any kind, such as coins, bills, tickets, etc.

(Conversión Fahrenheit Celsius)

> Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion formula
>
> Let $C$ be the temperature in Celsius, $F$ be the temperature in Fahrenheit, then
> $$C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$

> Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion formula
>
> Let $C$ be the temperature in Celsius, $F$ be the temperature in Fahrenheit, then
> $$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

(Medición de distancia)
**Measure of distance**: the process of determining the distance between two points. The ruler (la regla) is the basic instrument to measure distance. Rulers measure distance in units such as inches (pulgadas) and centimeters (centímetros).

> Distance notation
>
> Let $A$ and $B$ be two points, the segment that they form as endpoints is $\overline{AB}$, and the measure of the distance of this segment is denoted by $AB$ or $m \overline{AB}$.

> Method of distance measurement using a ruler
>
> 1. Make sure that the ruler can be fitted in the space between the two points whose distance is being measured.
> 2. Place the $0$ tick of the ruler in one of the points.
> 3. Place the ruler so that the ticks touch the second point.
> 4. Read the number of the tick nearest to the second point, this is the measure of the distance.

This method can be used to draw a given length.

(Transportador)
**Protractor**: instrument to measure angles. The most common units of measure are degrees and radians. Degrees denote a rotation of a full circle as $360 \text{\textdegree}$, and in radians this is denoted as $2 \pi$.

An angle can be measured in two ways, because there are two ways in which a ray can be rotated to coincide with another (rotating the ray clockwise, and rotating the ray counterclockwise). The standard definition of the measure of an angle, is that it's the smallest measure of the two. The smallest measure of an angle is always less than or equal to half a circle, i.e. $180 \text{\textdegree}$ or $\pi$ radians.

> Angle measure notation
>
> Let $A$, $B$, $C$, be three points that form an angle with vertex $B$, then the angle $\angle ABC$ has a measure denoted as $m \angle ABC$, or also $m \angle B$.

> Method of angle measurement using a protractor
>
> 1. Place the vertex of the protractor on top of the vertex of the rays whose angle is being measured.
> 2. Make sure that both rays extend beyond the protractor.
> 3. Rotate the protractor around its vertex so that the $0$ tick is aligned with one of the rays. The other ray must be under the protractor, otherwise put the $0$ tick under the other ray.
> 4. Read the number of the tick nearest to the other ray, this is the measure of the angle.

This method can be used to draw a given angle.

(Regla no graduada)
**Straightedge**: an instrument used to make straight lines, like a ruler but without tick marks.

> Method to copy an angle using a straightedge and a compass
>
> This method assumes both angles are being depicted in paper or in a similar way.
> 1. Choose which is the first ray and which the second ray in the angle being copied.
> 2. Make a copy of the first ray with the straightedge.
> 3. Center the compass on the vertex of the angle being copied, draw an arc at any radius such that the arc passes over both rays. Repeat this arc in the copied ray from step 2.
> 4. Center the compass in the angle being copied at the intersection of the arc from step 3 and the first ray. Open (or close) the compass to draw an arc that passes through the intersection of the arc from step 3 and the second ray. Repeat this arc in the copied ray from step 2.
> 5. Draw a line with the straightedge in the new copy of the angle, that passes through its vertex and the intersection of the two arcs that should have formed from the previous steps, the resulting angle is a copy of the first one.

(Construcción de la mediatriz)
**Perpendicular bisector construction**: a geometric construction to draw the perpendicular bisector of a given segment.

> Perpendicular bisector construction
>
> This construction requires paper, pencil, straightedge, and compass (or equivalent tools and materials).
> 1. Draw the segment whose perpendicular bisector will be constructed, with space around it.
> 2. Center the compass on one of the endpoints of the segment from step 1, with a radius greater than half the length of the segment. Draw arcs above and below the segment. Repeat this step with the other endpoing of the segment, ensuring that the arcs above and below intercept, and being careful to not change the radius of the compass.
> 3. Draw a line that passes through both arc interceptions above and below the segment, this line bisects the segment perpendicularly.
>
> This construction works as long as the radius of the compass is the same on both endpoints, because this would create two circles of equal radii, and the line that passes through their arc interceptions must be at equal distance from both centers, which is the midpoint of the segment between the centers.
>
> If one radius is smaller, this can serve to create lines that cross the segment at other fractions different from one half the lenght of the segment.

> 2. Calculate the slope of the perpendicular line as $m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}$.
> 3. Calculate the $y$-intercept of the perpendicular line as $b_2 = y_A - m_2x_A$, where $x_A$ and $y_A$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point $A$ respectively.
> 4. Find the coordinates of the point of intersection $B$, namely $x_B$, $y_B$, by equating the equation of the line $l$ and the equation of the perpendicular line, $m_1x_B + b_1 = m_2x_B + b_2$. From this equation, isolate $x_B$ as $x_B = \frac{b_2 - b_1}{m_1 - m_2}$.
> 5. Find $y_B$ as $y_B = m_1x_B + b_1$.
> 6. Calculate the distance between $A$ and $B$ with the distance formula, $AB = \sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}$.

**Indirect measurement**: a way to measure lengths that can't be accessed directly (lengths to places that are unreachable), using triangle similarity. For example, this can serve to measure lengths such as the width of a river, or the height of a tall building. It's an algorithm.

*Indirect measurement*

As shown, $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle ADE$. In indirect measurement, the length $DE$ is the length that wants to be measured but is inaccessible. The points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, should be walkable, so only the point $E$ can be unreachable.

> 1. Observe the terrain to place the points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. The point $E$ can be out of reach.
> 2. Make sure that $\angle ABC \cong \angle ADE$, that the points $A$, $C$, and $E$ are collinear, and that the points $A$, $B$, and $D$ are also collinear.
> 3. Measure the lengths $AB$, $AD$, and $BC$.
> 4. Calculate the scale factor $k$ to obtain $\triangle ADE$ from $\triangle ABC$, $k = \frac{AD}{AB}$.
> 5. Calculate $DE$ which is the indirect measurement, as $DE = k BC$.

**Indirect measurement using a right triangle**: there is a different way to do indirect measurement, that doesn't require a smaller similar triangle.

In $\triangle ABC$, if $\angle B$ is a right angle, $C$ is the unreachable point, and $BC$ is the length to measure indirectly, then $BC = AB tan(\angle A)$, where $tan$ is the tangent function, so $\angle A$ and $AB$ must be measured.
